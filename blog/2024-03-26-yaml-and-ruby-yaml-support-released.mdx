We are happy to announce that we released support for [Ruby on Rails YAML](/platform/formats/ruby_yaml),
[Flat YAML](/platform/formats/flat_yaml), and [Structured YAML](/platform/formats/structured_yaml) formats.

<!--truncate-->

Recently, we have released the various format support, but few formats were still missing. Now, we are adding few more.
Tolgee now supports Ruby on Rails YAML, Flat YAML, and Structured YAML formats.

That means that Tolgee can import and export data in Ruby on Rails specific YAML files, structured YAML files and flat YAML files.
Ruby on Rails placeholder and message format e.g. `hello %{name}` or `I have %<count>d dogs` is now supported
as well as pluralization and arrays.

Let us know in the [Tolgee Slack community](https://Tolg.ee/slack) if you have any questions about those new features!
