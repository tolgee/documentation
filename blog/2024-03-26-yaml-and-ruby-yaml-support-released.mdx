We are happy to announce that we released support for [Ruby on Rails YAML](/platform/formats/ruby_yaml),
[Flat YAML](/platform/formats/flat_yaml), and [Structured YAML](/platform/formats/structured_yaml) formats.

<!--truncate-->

Recently, we have released various format support, but a few formats were still missing. Now, we are adding a few more.
Tolgee now supports Ruby on Rails YAML, Flat YAML, and Structured YAML formats.

That means that Tolgee can import and export data in Ruby on Rails-specific YAML files, structured YAML files and flat YAML files.
Ruby on Rails placeholder and message format e.g. `hello %{name}` or `I have %<count>d dogs` is now supported
as well as pluralization and arrays.

At the same time, we made XLIFF, JSON and PO formats generic, so now you can choose the desired message & placeholder
format when you export to such a file type. You can read more about the supported placeholder and message formats [here](/platform/formats/message_placeholder_format).

Let us know in the [Tolgee Slack community](https://Tolg.ee/slack) if you have any questions about those new features!
