Translating an App to multiple languages ([localization](/blog/localization-basics-S01E01)) is tricky part of many applications. Tolgee is simplifying the localization process and saves developer's time by removing repetitive tasks 🔁 ❌.

In this article, we'll explore how Tolgee offers a streamlined solution for React localization, empowering developers to efficiently translate and adapt their applications for diverse audiences. From simplifying text translation to providing **in-context editing features**, Tolgee revolutionizes the localization experience for React developers.

Saving time? That's what I want. Show me how to localize my React app!

## What is Tolgee?

Tolgee is an **open-source** i18n tool combining a localization platform and [SDKs](/js-sdk/) to provide a simple way to translate web applications for both developers and translators. 👨‍💻👩🏻‍💻🧖🏼👩🏻‍💻🧖🏼 Tolgee is not just another software localization platform offering integrations that only syncs local data with the backend. Instead, Tolgee is **truly integrated into your app via SDKs**. So, no more looking for keys in your source code, no more editing localization files, and no more data exporting for translators.

## In-context translating

As a developer of localized application, you probably have to modify localization data every time you need to change a text. So you have to open the file, add or find the key to modify it, save it and check whether everything was changed correctly in the app. With Tolgee, you can just `ALT + click` the actual translated text in your app, and 💥boom💥 **translation dialog appears**, and you are able to translate it right away. You can even translate [in-context on production](/blog/in-context-production).

## Automatic Screenshot Generation 📸

Another tricky part of software localization is providing context 📖 to translators. Only exporting the keys and translations in the source language is not always enough. Tolgee enables you to take and [upload screenshot](/js-sdk/#automated-screenshots-generation) directly in the **in-context translation dialog**. So no more manual taking and uploading screenshots.🌄

## Localization platform included ✅

Tolgee is also a [localization platform](/platform) where you can manage all your localization strings 📚. So you can provide access to translators, and they can translate the texts there. If you have uploaded screenshots before, they **know the context of the translations** perfectly, so they can produce perfect results. You can watch a short tour in the Tolgee platform on our [YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/D2g7ly77st4).

## Isn't that hard to integrate? No, it's not!

To get started localizing your React app, you can simply follow the integration guides provided in the Tolgee localization platform, which is the simplest way to start.

1. Login to [Tolgee Cloud](https://app.tolgee.io) or use your self-hosted [Tolgee instance](/platform/self_hosting/running_with_docker).

2. Create a new project by clicking the **`Add` button in the top right**. And filling in the project name.

   ![Add button](/img/blog/add_project_button.webp)

   Optionally, you can add multiple languages to translate your React app into.

3. Select `Integrate` from the side menu, choose **React (Vite)** and generate an API key with **all scopes checked**.

   ![Integrate](/img/blog/integrations.webp)

4. Success! 🎉 Now you just have to follow the integration guide.

## Let's integrate it into React App

1.  Generate a brand new React App and open it to your favorite editor

      ```bash
      npm create vite@latest tolgee-hello-world -- --template react-ts
      # follow the vite guide
      ```


2.  Install Tolgee packages ⬇️
      ```bash
      npm install @tolgee/react
      ```

3.  Add Tolgee properties to your development `.env` file `env.development.local` by **copying it** from the integration guide

      ```bash
      VITE_APP_TOLGEE_API_URL=https://app.tolgee.io
      VITE_APP_TOLGEE_API_KEY=<your API key>
      ```

4.  Wrap your App component in `main.tsx` with `TolgeeProvider` component. Again, you can copy it from the integration guide.

5.  Go to `App.tsx` and replace all the crap with a simple "Hello world!" message.

    ```tsx
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

6.  Wrap the "Hello world!" with `<T>` component and add keyName prop.

    ```jsx
    import './App.css';
    import { T } from '@tolgee/react';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>
            <T keyName="hello_world">Hello world!</T>
          </h1>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

7.  Let's run the App in the browser and see the magic! 🪄 Hold your _ALT_ key and move your mouse over the text. It should be highlighted. When you click it, a dialog opens, and you're able to edit the text ✏️ or generate screenshots. 📷

    After you hit the update button, your `Hello World!` text will be immediately changed to the new value!

## Congratulations! You're done! 🎉🎉🎉

You can find the resulting code in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/JanCizmar/tolgee-react-hello-world), **but you have to add your `.env.development.local` file.**
