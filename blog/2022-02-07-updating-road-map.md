In Q4 of 2021, we planned to finish features like translation memory, automated/machine translating, glossaries or paywall
for Tolgee cloud. However, we spent a lot of time on upgrading a website and improving JS integrations. Sadly, we
haven't finished any of the features, we wanted to finish before the end of the year. So we have to reflect it in our
roadmap. We decided to reschedule everything and target more on the segment of developers than translators.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are introducing [improved roadmap](https://tolgee.io/roadmap)! ðŸŽ‰

<!--truncate-->

## 2022/Q1

We are just finishing the translation memory, machine translations and automated translating. So users translating their
projects in Tolgee platform will feel much more comfortable. The platform will be able to suggest translations from
the memory and from providers like Google Translate or AWS translate.

We would also like to provide more export options, create a nice project dashboard with statistics, enable users to see
history of translations or add more permission options.

## 2022/Q2

In the second quarter of 2022, we would like to introduce Glossaries, so users will be able to manage their terminology
and reuse that across multiple projects. Also, we would like to introduce a billing for Tolgee Cloud. Users
will be able to buy seats for their team members.

## 2022/Q3-Q4

In the rest of the year, we would like to provide QA checks, design tools integrations, support for mobile apps,
Git integrations, branching or translator marketplace.

## Full roadmap
