We are thrilled to announce that Tolgee now supports the [Compose Multiplatform XML Resources format](/platform/formats/compose_multiplatform_xml), a format for managing localization in Compose Multiplatform projects.

<!--truncate-->

Slowly churning through all the requested formats, the next format missing in Tolgee was the Compose Multiplatform XML Resources format, support for which has just landed in Tolgee. Now you can import and export your localization data in the Compose Multiplatform XML Resources format.

The Compose Multiplatform XML Resources format is similar to Android's XML Resources but has unique differences in formatting and escaping. Tolgee handles these and ensures that the formatting is preserved during import and export.
