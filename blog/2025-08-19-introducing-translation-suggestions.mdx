**Translation Suggestions** enables controlled collaboration by allowing team members to propose translation improvements while keeping reviewers in control of what gets published.

## How Translation Suggestions Work

Team members click **"Suggest"** to propose improvements, which reviewers can then accept or reject:

  alt="Accepting a translation suggestion"
/>

## Translation Protection and Permissions

Translation protection prevents direct edits to reviewed translations. When enabled, translators can only suggest changes to already-reviewed content, ensuring approved translations remain stable while still allowing improvements.

For more control, granular permissions (a paid feature) let you configure suggestion access per user. You can restrict users to suggestion-only mode, preventing them from making direct edits to any translations.

  alt="Granular permissions for translation suggestions"
/>

Here's how the protection works in practice. Reviewed translations become suggestion-only.

/>

## Ready to Collaborate Better?

Translation Suggestions integrate with existing Tolgee workflows. Enable suggestions mode in your project settings, configure appropriate permissions, and your team can start proposing improvements while maintaining quality control.

Check out the [Translation Suggestions documentation](/platform/projects_and_organizations/suggestions) to get started.
