We are excited to announce that Tolgee now supports the [CSV format](/platform/formats/csv), a simple format for table-like data. In Tolgee, you can import and export your localization data in CSV format.

One less format to worry about! The support for the CSV format has landed in Tolgee. For those who store their localization data in CSV files, you can now import and export your data and manage them in Tolgee. [Read more in the docs](/platform/formats/csv).

When conversion to ICU placeholders is enabled, you can choose from various placeholder & message formats to use with CSV.

Do you have any questions about those new features? Join the [Tolgee Slack community](https://Tolg.ee/slack) and let us know!
