One of the very distinct localization industries is video game localization, and Tolgee also has a solution for it! We have released an update to our Unreal Engine plugin that brings native integration of Tolgee with the Localization Dashboard and powerful new localization features for game developers to translate in real time using Tolgee in Unreal Engine.

## What's New:

You can check out the updated version of [Tolgee Unreal Engine SDK on Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/6e79848b-f777-404d-b232-673b90ab0d0b). Here is what we added:

### **Native Localization Service Provider**

The biggest change in this update is that Tolgee now functions as a **Localization Service Provider** within Unreal Engine. Tolgee now integrates directly with Unreal's Localization Dashboard. Instead of working with separate tools and workflows, developers can now manage their translations seamlessly within Unreal Engine.

### **Hot-Reload Translation Support**

This lets you translate live while your Unreal Engine project is running.

- **Play-in-Editor:** Fetch translations directly from Tolgee's web dashboard in real-time
- **Packaged Games**: Dynamic translation updates via CDN without requiring new builds

### **Push & Pull Actions**

We introduced push and pull commands to manage the interaction between Unreal Engine and Tolgee. These commands let you sync translations between Unreal and Tolgee. 

Push - lets you add new keys to the Tolgee platform. If you would like to start localizing or update your current keys on the Tolgee platform, click “Push” to add new keys.

Pull - lets you add new keys from Tolgee to your UE project. If you are working on a project that already has the keys added on Tolgee, you can click “Pull” in the Tolgee plugin to update the keys in your Unreal Engine project with the new translations.

### **In-Context Translation**

The Unreal plugin provides the same `In Context` translation as other Tolgee tools. Devs can open a debug panel in the running game, hover over any text, and instantly edit translations through the corresponding Tolgee key.

## How Does It Make Your Development Easier?

These updates eliminate the back-and-forth movements between game testing and translation tools. You can now see translation changes instantly during development and even update live games post-release.
The updated plugin is available now for both new and existing Unreal Engine projects. You can find it on Fab [here](https://www.fab.com/listings/6e79848b-f777-404d-b232-673b90ab0d0b).
