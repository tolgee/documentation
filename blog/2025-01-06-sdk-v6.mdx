With Tolgee SDK Version 6, fetching translations for your Next.js applications is easier than ever. 🚀 You can prefetch translation data on the server and seamlessly pass it to the client, ensuring smooth and efficient localization. ✅

<!-- truncate-->

### Fetching Required Translations with `loadRequired`

The `loadRequired` method fetches translations based on the current language and namespace settings. Use it on the server to prefetch data and on the client to avoid extra fetches: 

```ts
// Server-side
const translations = JSON.stringify(await tolgee.loadRequired());

// Client-side
tolgee.addStaticData(JSON.parse(translations));
```

This approach ensures the client has the translations ready without additional requests. 🔄✨

### Advanced Prefetching with `loadMatrix` 🌟

For greater control, use `loadMatrix` to prefetch specific languages and namespaces.

```ts
// Fetch translations for multiple languages and namespaces
const translations = await tolgee.loadMatrix({
  languages: ['en', 'cs'],
  namespaces: ['common', 'info']
});
```

To prefetch all namespaces for a language:

```ts
await tolgee.loadMatrix({
  languages: ['en'],
  namespaces: 'all'
});
t('app_title', { ns: 'info' });
```

These tools make it simple to fetch and render translations, streamlining the localization process for server-rendered and server components. ✨🎯
