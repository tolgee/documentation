## Using Tolgee as a client for fetching translations

With Tolgee SDK Version 6, fetching translations for your Next.js applications is easier than ever. You can prefetch translation data on the server and seamlessly pass it to the client, ensuring smooth and efficient localization.

### Fetching Required Translations with `loadRequired`

The `loadRequired` method fetches translations based on the current language and namespace settings. Use it on the server to prefetch data and on the client to avoid extra fetches:

```ts
// Server-side
const translations = JSON.stringify(await tolgee.loadRequired());

// Client-side
tolgee.addStaticData(JSON.parse(translations));
```

This approach ensures the client has the translations ready without additional requests.

### Advanced Prefetching with `loadMatrix`

For greater control, use `loadMatrix` to prefetch specific languages and namespaces. 

```ts
// Fetch translations for multiple languages and namespaces
const translations = await tolgee.loadMatrix({
  languages: ['en', 'cs'],
  namespaces: ['common', 'info']
});
```

To prefetch all namespaces for a language:

```ts
await tolgee.loadMatrix({
  languages: ['en'],
  namespaces: 'all'
});
t('app_title', { ns: 'info' });
```

These tools make it simple to fetch and render translations, streamlining the localization process for server-rendered and server components.
