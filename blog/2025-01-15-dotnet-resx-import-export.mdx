We’re excited to share that Tolgee now supports the [.NET RESX format](/platform/formats/dotnet_resx) (also known as resx .net or res x), a format for localization in .NET applications. This update benefits every .NET app.

This means that now you can import and export your localization files in the RESX format, making it easier than ever to integrate Tolgee into your .NET workflows. Simply use your RESX file in our translator software.

## What is ASP.NET Core and RESX format?

ASP.NET Core is an open-source and cross-platform framework developed for building web apps, APIs, and microservices. ASP.NET Core supports development on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It works well with cloud services and modern tools like Docker and Kubernetes. It has a modular architecture, and for building dynamic web content, it supports  Model View Controller and Razor Pages.

The RESX format is popular for its simplicity and integration with the .NET ecosystem. It’s XML-based, with support for localizing strings, images, and other resources. With Tolgee’s support, you can now manage your string resources effortlessly using any standard resource file format.

## ASP.NET Core, RESX files and Translator Software

Whether you’re building using ASP.NET Core, a WPF app, or anything else in the .NET world, just upload your RESX files to Tolgee, make your edits, and export them back, ready to use in your project, applying language translator software.
