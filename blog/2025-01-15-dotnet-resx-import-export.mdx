We’re excited to share that Tolgee now supports the [.NET RESX format](/platform/formats/dotnet_resx), a format for localization in .NET applications.

<!--truncate-->

This means you can now import and export your localization files in the RESX format, making it easier than
ever to integrate Tolgee into your .NET workflows.

The RESX format is popular for its simplicity and integration with the .NET ecosystem. It’s XML-based, with support
for localizing strings, images, and other resources. With Tolgee’s support, you can now manage your string resources.

Whether you’re building ASP.NET applications, WPF apps, or anything else in the .NET world, just upload your
RESX files to Tolgee, make your edits, and export them back, ready to use in your project.

Try it out and let us know what you think! As always, your feedback helps us improve. Happy localizing!
