Ever had a team member suggest a better translation, but you're worried about giving them full editing access? Translation teams often face this challenge: enabling collaboration while maintaining quality control.

<!--truncate-->

This is a common problem in translation workflows. **Translation Suggestions** addresses this by allowing team members to propose translation improvements while keeping reviewers in control of what gets published.

## The Problem

Consider this scenario: Your Spanish-speaking colleague notices that "Remove item" should be "Eliminar elemento" instead of "Quitar elemento" in your app. However, giving them full translation access creates risk – they might accidentally modify critical translations.

Traditional translation workflows force you to choose between restrictive access (limiting collaboration) or full access (creating quality risks).

## How Translation Suggestions Work

The workflow is straightforward. When someone wants to improve a translation, they click **"Suggest"** instead of directly editing:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-menu.webp"
  alt="Translation suggestion menu showing the Suggest button"
/>

They can propose their improvement, and you get to review it before it goes live:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-created.webp"
  alt="Creating a new translation suggestion with AI assistance"
/>

Reviewers can then click **"Accept"** to apply the suggestion as the new translation:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-accept.webp"
  alt="Accepting a translation suggestion"
/>

## Translation Protection and Permissions

Translation protection prevents direct edits to reviewed translations. When enabled, translators can only suggest changes to already-reviewed content, ensuring approved translations remain stable while still allowing improvements.

For more control, granular permissions (a paid feature) let you configure suggestion access per user. You can restrict users to suggestion-only mode, preventing them from making direct edits to any translations.

  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestions-granular-permissions.webp"
  alt="Granular permissions for translation suggestions"
/>

Here's how the protection works in practice – reviewed translations become suggestion-only:

  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/translation-protection-suggest-only.webp"
  alt="Translation protection set to suggest-only mode"
/>

## Ready to Collaborate Better?

Translation Suggestions integrate with existing Tolgee workflows. Enable suggestions mode in your project settings, configure appropriate permissions, and your team can start proposing improvements while maintaining quality control.

Check out the [Translation Suggestions documentation](/platform/projects_and_organizations/suggestions) to get started.
