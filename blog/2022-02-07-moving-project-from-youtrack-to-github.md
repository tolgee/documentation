![Moving from YoyTrack to GitHub](/img/blog/movingFromYoutrack.png)

Before I started to work on Tolgee I was used to working with Jira. But I didn't like it much, so I chose YouTrack for
project monitoring that time. Now it seems better to move the project management to GitHub, since it's more transparent
for developers. Also, there is a kanban board feature on GitHub, so we can move the issues as we were used to in
YouTrack, but it's also visible to everyone.
