We are excited to announce that Tolgee now supports the [Single Sign-On (SSO) with OpenID](/platform/sso/sso_getting_started).

<!--truncate-->

With growing customer base, we've noticed an increasing demand for Single Sign-On (SSO) support, especially when it comes to enterprise customers.
Today, is a big day as we are introducing the Single Sign-On (SSO) support in Tolgee. This feature is available for enterprise plans both in the cloud and self-hosted versions.
Self-hosted instances as a bonus can choose to set up the SSO instance-wide instead of per organization mode we will be using for our cloud instance.
