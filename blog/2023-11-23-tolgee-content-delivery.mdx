## Load your translations from the cloud

Introducing [Tolgee Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery), the solution to simplify your translation updates seamlessly. With automatic uploading of localization files to secure cloud storage, your translations remain independent from your codebase, ensuring effortless updates.

### We prioritize Speed and Reliability

Utilizing Content Delivery Network (CDN), Tolgee Content Delivery guarantees **lightning-fast access** to your translated content worldwide. Our caching system ensures reliability, even across different geographical locations.

Because the content is heavily cached, it can take up to 15 minutes to propagate. This balance ensures consistent and dependable delivery while catering to various localization needs.

### Tailored Export Settings

Customize your translation exports effortlessly. Users have the freedom to configure file formats and other export settings, adapting the process to their unique workflows.
