## Load your translations from the cloud

Introducing [Tolgee Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery), the solution to simplify your translation updates seamlessly. With automatic uploading of localization files to secure cloud storage, your translations remain independent from your codebase, ensuring effortless updates.

### We prioritize Speed and Reliability

Utilizing Content Delivery Network (CDN), Tolgee Content Delivery guarantees **lightning-fast access** to your translated content worldwide. Our caching system ensures reliability and speed, across different geographical locations.

> Because the content is heavily cached, it can take up to 15 minutes to propagate changes.

### Tailored Export Settings

Customize your translation exports effortlessly. Users have the freedom to configure file formats and other export settings, adapting the process to their unique workflows.
