We’ve got exciting news to share! Tolgee now supports importing and exporting localization data in the XLSX format.

<!--truncate-->

While XLSX isn’t the ideal format for managing translations long-term, we know it’s a common starting point for many.
By making it easier to work with what you already have, we hope to simplify your localization process and help you transition smoothly to a workflow that works best for you.

Ready to give it a try? Upload your XLSX files, let Tolgee handle the heavy lifting, and enjoy a seamless localization experience.
As always, we’d love to hear your feedback. Happy translating, everyone!
