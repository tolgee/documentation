## What does the Figma plugin do?
With our new Figma plugin, you can **seamlessly push text from your Figma designs to Tolgee**, including creating screenshots. This saves you the time and effort of manually copying and pasting text, and ensures that all text is accurately captured for translation.

What's more, the plugin allows you to **connect your text to existing keys in Tolgee**, making it easy to manage translations across multiple projects. This streamlines the translation process, ensuring that your translations are consistent and accurate across all your designs and projects.

Once your text is in Tolgee, you can easily **pull translations back into your Figma designs**, making it easy to see how your designs will look in different languages. This feature is especially useful for designers who need to work with multiple languages and want to ensure that their designs are optimized for each market.

Additionally, the plugin allows you to **create page copies with key names or translations**, with duplicate pages of translations ensuring that the layout remains consistent across different languages. Duplicated pages with key names are particularly useful for developers, as they provide clear guidance on which key names to use in the code.
