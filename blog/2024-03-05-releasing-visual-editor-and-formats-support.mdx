We are happy to announce that we finally released tools enabling you to use Tolgee not only with limited set of formats
like JSON or XLIFF with limited features. Now you translate iOS, Mac and other Apple platform Apps, Android, Flutter,
PHP and C++. Also, you can reliably export to generic formats like Structured JSON with support for arrays or XLIFF.

To provide convenient way of editing translations for developers, translators, project manager and other stakeholders, we
made our editor visual, so you can conveniently edit plurals, and you can edit strings without need to understand the
placeholders or HTML tags syntax.

## The new formats support freshly out of the oven
Tolgee now supports the following formats:
- Tolgee Native JSON
- Generic Structured JSON (With Arrays Support)
- Generic XLIFF
- Apple .strings and .stringsdict (for iOS, MacOS and other Apple platforms)
- Android Resources XML
- Flutter ARB
- PHP Gettext .po
- C/C++ Gettext .po
- Java (.properties)

Convenient plurals editing in the visual editor is supported for all formats as well as placeholders visualization as
described below.

## The visual editor
There are several issues regarding editing translation messages in different message formats and in raw HTML. For
example this ICU message:

```json
"Hello, {name}! You have been promoted to <strong>{position}</strong>"
```

To edit such message, the translator need to understand several the ICU Message Syntax, so they know the `{name}` and
`{position}` are placeholders representing the user's name and new position. They need to know that the `<strong>` is
an HTML tag, they must not translate (e.g. to `<fuerte>` to spanish). The purpose of visual editor is hide the syntax
from the translators and provide convenient way to edit such messages.

import { ScreenshotWrapper } from "../platform/shared/_ScreenshotWrapper";

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/blog/visual-editor-and-formats-support/visual_editor.webp" alt="Visual editor" />

This way, the translator to spanish only need to type the text to be actually translator and add the placeholders by
clicking the missing placeholders below the input field.

Another benefit of the visual editor is the convenience when editing **right-to-left** language translations.
The placeholders and HTML are still left-to-right and mixing them with right-to-left leads to weird cursor movements and
behaviour. When displaying visualized placeholders instead of the raw syntax, the translator's cursors always moves
natural, and they don't have to think about the order of opening and closing HTML tags.

## Tolgee Universal ICU Placeholders
For formats, which are not natively using ICU Message Format, Tolgee is able to convert the placeholders to
the Tolgee Universal ICU Placeholders when importing, so you can edit them in the visual editor.
These placeholders are then converted back when exporting.

The main benefit of using unified placeholder syntax is that you're able to use the same localization data in different
target platforms, since these placeholders can be converting to every supported format.
