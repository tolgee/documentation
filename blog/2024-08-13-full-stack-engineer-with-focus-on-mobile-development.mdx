## About Tolgee
At Tolgee, we're revolutionizing how companies localize their software. Our mission? To help development teams translate their projects into multiple languages faster and more efficiently than ever before. As Tolgee is a developer-oriented product, we're passionate about making developer's lives easier.

Tolgee started as an open-source project in 2020, a university thesis that earned a Dean's Award. Since then, we've been growing Tolgee and attracting users worldwide. We've also joined the Technology Incubation program, where we developed our own AI machine translator. Recently, we've secured our seed investment enabling us to grow our team.

Tolgee is open-source, but in the same time, we focus on sustainable business growth. Our revenue grows by 8% each month, and we aim for 12% in the next 18 months. Inspired by companies like PostHog, GitLab, and Sentry, we want to become the top choice for developers in localization (i18n).

## What we value
- We are open-source, building a vast community, and making a free, self-hosted product, which is crucial to our philosophy.
- We are transparent. Really. We build our product publicly, sharing our plans as individual tasks on GitHub in public repositories. Everyone can read our code, and everyone can improve it.
- We give people as much freedom as possible while keeping them responsible for the results. We value autonomous people who have ideas and are willing to implement them themselves or find the resources to get things done.
- We ship fast, but at the same time, we provide stable and tested products.

## Who we are looking for
We are looking for someone extraordinary, who will become integral part of Tolgee team and who will build the best ever i18n mobile SDKs for Android, iOS or Flutter. However, we are also looking for someone not scared to touch other parts of the toolkit like backend. And remember! We are a developer-oriented tool, so we must provide excellent documentation and inspire other developers.

## What you'll be doing
- Building i18n SDKs for Android, iOS or Flutter
- Making the product stable and clean by refactoring and proper testing
- Writing super clear docs about the integrations
- Coming up with fresh ideas for features or ways how Tolgee can succeed in being the next leader in the scope
- Show the Tolgee's cool features on demo sessions from a technical perspective.
- Being inspiring to other developers and the community by writing impressive articles when something interesting comes up

## Requirements
- Experience as a mobile developer
- Ability to think about edge cases and errors and be able to test them reliably
- Love to write clean and readable code
- A working knowledge of Android and/or iOS and/or Flutter
- You have started some projects from scratch. You might have led a project, been a founder or built an impressive side project. Don't hesitate to share this with us!

**Nice to have**

- Experience with backend development
- Experience with web frontend in React, Angular or Vue.js

## Salary
- €4000 - €6000/month
- ESOP (Yeah, you will get significant shares in the company)

## Benefits
- Unlimited vacation
- Home office or whatever works for you.
- 2-3 meeting-less days per week
- Did we tell you about the ESOP? We have to say it again because not many (if any) companies on the market would offer you 1-2% of the company share

## Our hiring process
1. Quick intro, where we answer your questions and ask you a few (30 minutes)
2. Deeper interview, where you will tell us more about your past jobs (2 hours)
3. Tolgee Super Day! We will hire for a day in Tolgee, give you a real task, take you for a lunch and we'll se if you're a good fit. (1 working day)
4. Finally, you'll get a job offer!

Join the growing Tolgee Team as our New Full-Stack Engineer! If you're passionate about innovative solutions and want to make a big impact, Tolgee is the place for you. Join us and help shape the future of software localization!
