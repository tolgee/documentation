We're excited to introduce a new feature in Tolgee that simplifies translation project management: Tasks. This tool helps you assign, track, and complete translation and review tasks efficiently, all within one platform.  

<!--truncate-->

This tool is designed to simplify and supercharge the way you manage translation and review jobs. Available in our business and enterprise plans, Tasks allow you to assign specific jobs to team members, track progress, and meet deadlines — all in one convenient place. Here’s a quick overview of what Tasks bring to your workflow and why we think they’ll make a big difference! 🌟


## Why Did We Add Tasks? 🤔

Managing translation projects, especially those with multiple languages and contributors, can quickly become tricky. Our new Tasks feature tackles this challenge head-on, providing a clear and structured way to assign work and keep track of its completion. Whether you're translating, reviewing, or both, Tasks ensure that every job is accounted for and nothing slips through the cracks. ✅

## How Do Tasks Help? 💡

With Tasks, you can:

- **Assign specific jobs**: Break down a translation project into manageable chunks by assigning individual tasks based on language or job type (translate or review). 🎯
- **Monitor progress**: Track the status of each task at a glance, from "New" to "In Progress", "Done" or "Closed". 🔍
- **Stay organized**: Keep everyone on the same page with task notifications, due dates, and easy-to-access overviews. 📅
- **Elevate permissions**: Users assigned a task automatically gain the necessary permissions to complete their job, streamlining collaboration. 🙌
- **Streamline your workflow**: Creating a task is super simple! Start directly from the Tasks section or use Batch operations to select specific translation keys. Customize each task with details like task type, languages, due dates, and more to fit your project needs perfectly. 🔧
- **Advanced metrics**: Check how many words or characters need translation, so you can easily provide this data to your translators. 📊

Once tasks are assigned, team members receive notifications 🔔 and can jump into translations or reviews right from their dashboards. Tracking progress is a breeze, and tasks can be marked as "complete" or "closed" when the work is done. 🎉

## More Than Just Task Management 🌈

We’ve packed in even more! With Tasks, you can generate detailed reports to see who worked on what, clone tasks for different languages, and even create follow-up review tasks. These additions give you full visibility into your team's efforts, ensuring nothing is missed. 🌟

## Ready to Try?

Tasks are now live for paid plans, bringing a new level of efficiency to your translation projects. If you’re on a self-hosted version, be sure to set up your license to unlock this feature.
