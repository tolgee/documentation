HHello, amazing Tolgee self-hosters ü§ü

In this tutorial you will learn how to self-host Tolgee for using with Content Delivery features with S3 bucket
(or Azure Blob).

Free self-hosted version allows you to create single Content Delivery configuration, and you will have to stick with
single storage configuration per your instance.

<!--truncate-->

To self-host Tolgee, you can use several different deployment options. You can use a simple Docker container, run the
Java .jar file or use Kubernetes or other orchestration tools. In this tutorial, we will use docker-compose with
a standalone Postgres database.

To follow this tutorial, you can clone
[this repository](https://github.com/tolgee/docker-compose-content-delivery-example), to get started quickly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tolgee/docker-compose-content-delivery-example.git
```

## The Docker Compose configuration

According to the [self-hosting documentation](/platform/self_hosting/running_with_docker#running-with-docker-compose-with-external-postgresql-database)
section, this is how your `docker-compose.yaml` should look like.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: tolgee/tolgee:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./config.yaml:/config.yaml
    ports:
      - '8089:8080'
    environment:
      spring.config.additional-location: file:///config.yaml
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    volumes:
      - ./data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - '25432:5432' # <-- If you want to access your postgres from outside of docker network
```

The configuration file that is mounted to the container should look like the one below. It's recommended that
the configuration be provided via a mounted property file. It's cleaner to read, and it's better for security since the environment variables can be
subject to logs.

```yaml title="config.yaml"
tolgee:
  postgres-autostart:
    enabled: false
  authentication:
    enabled: true
  content-delivery:
    public-url-prefix:
    storage:
#      Uncomment this for Azure Blob
#      azure:
#        connection-string:
#        container-name:
      s3:
        access-key:
        bucket-name:
        endpoint:
        secret-key:
        signing-region:
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
```

It's also a good idea to change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in both files to something more secure.

## Setting up S3 bucket
For the simplicity of this tutorial, we will create a public S3 bucket. For optimized configurations, you might want to put
Amazon CloudFront in front of it, but I will leave this to you. Providing **storage configuration is required to
use Content Delivery** features on the free self-hosted instance.

1. Go to [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
2. Click on `Create bucket`
3. Fill in the bucket name. I am naming it `tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234`
4. Deselect `Block all public access` and acknowledge that the bucket will be public
   (ignore if you plan to use CloudFront or other)
5. Click `Create bucket`
6. **Ignore following steps if you plan to use CloudFront or other**
7. Open the bucket by clicking it in the list
8. Go to permissions and add this `Bucket policy` json and replace the bucket name with your name. This will
   make your bucket public.
    ```
    {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234/*"
           }
       ]
    }
   ```

Now. You have your S3 bucket ready.

Great! üéâ Now you have your S3 bucket ready.

Now we need to create credentials to access this bucket.

1. Go to [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
2. Click on `Users` in the left menu
3. Click on `Add user`
4. Fill in the username. I am naming it `tolgee-cdn-user-1234`
5. Go to step 2 `Set permissions`
6. Click on `Attach existing policies directly`
7. Click on `Create policy`
8. Click on `JSON` tab and paste this
   ```
 {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAttributes",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234",
                "arn:aws:s3:::tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
 }
   ```
9. Review and create policy. I am naming it TolgeeCdnBucketPolicy
10. Select this policy in the user creation wizard
11. Create the user
12. Go to `Security credentials` tab of the new user
13. Click on `Create access key`
14. Select `Third-party service` or `Other`
15. Finish the creation

Store the Access key and Secret key in a safe place. You will need them in the next step.

Cool! Now you have everything ready. You can fill in the `config.yaml` file with the credentials.
I am using the eu-central-1 region.

```yaml
  ...
  content-delivery:
    public-url-prefix: https://tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
    storage:
      s3:
        access-key: AKIA...............
        bucket-name: tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234
        endpoint: s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
        secret-key: <your secret key>
        signing-region: eu-central-1
  ...
```

:::info
Don't forget that the `public-url-prefix` and one of the storage configurations are required to use
Content Delivery features unless are on an advanced self-hosted plan with per-project content storages enabled.
:::

## Testing time
Let's run the beast.
```
docker compose up
```

When the service is running, you can run this command to obtain the initial admin password stored in `data/initial.pwd`

```
cat data/initial.pwd
```

Now open your browser on [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089) and log in with
 - username: admin
 - password: `the initial password obtained in previous step`

Then open the demo project and go to the developer settings (`</>`) section accessible from the menu on the left.

You should see empty list of the content delivery configurations.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/blog/docker-compose-with-content-delivery/empty-list.webp"
                   alt="Screenshot of empty list of content delivery configurations" />

### Creating new content delivery
1. Hit the `+ Content delivery` button
2. Keep the properties as they are and hit save
3. `Content delivery successfully created!` message should be prompted

By now, you should have your project data uploaded to the S3 bucket and made accessible.
For my public url prefix, this file can be accessed on

```
https://tolgee-cdn-bucket-1234.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/305b9eb32a8c9de207af72c9232f29af/en.json
```
