Using AI for translation instead of traditional translators, like DeepL, is becoming increasingly popular. The belief is usually that it sounds more natural and sometimes even cheaper. Often it actually is! 

<!--truncate-->

However, everyone who works with localization knows the frustration: your AI translator suggests "Delete" when your users expect "Remove." The problem often lies in the lack of context. Traditional translation tools process text strings by string without understanding where they'll appear. AI translation often solves this problem, but without full textual and visual context, it is still often inaccurate, like in the previous example.

That's why we're excited to introduce Tolgee's AI Playground and Glossaries. These are revolutionary tools that combine the power of AI translation with full context for the best results, and Glossaries help to stay consistent with your content.

## No-Prompt Solution

With the [basic AI playground](/platform/translation_process/ai-playground#basic-mode), you won't need to spend time thinking of a perfect prompt. With the click of a button, “Customize,” in the Machine translation menu, you can open a powerful tool to adjust AI if needed. There you can find the AI playground. Simply toggle the parts of context you want your AI provider to use for precise translation. 

For example, you can use the project description, key description, language notes, and you can use screenshots to provide visual context (though toggling them on will take longer to process the translation and might cost more)

Screenshots are very useful for the most accurate results as they provide AI with information on what the users will see and what they will interact with. Despite the drawbacks of slower speeds and higher costs, this feature ensures the most accurate and logical translation.

## Use the Best LLM for Each Case

As you may know, different LLMs have different strong and weak sides. Some behave better in languages that others don't. For this, you can switch the [LLM provider](/platform/projects_and_organizations/llm-providers) from OpenAI to, for example, Claude or other ones.

                   alt="Tolgee change LLM provider example" />

Besides, you can assign specific prompts to different languages! This helps to set specific presets for each language. You can learn how to do that by following this [documentation](/platform/translation_process/ai-playground#saving-prompts-and-using-them-in-the-platform). 

A good example of this is when you need to differentiate between different dialects of the same language. For example, when you want to translate something, consider how people speak Spanish in Latin America versus Spain (or even between different Latin American countries). 

It can be configured even better using [Advanced Mode](/platform/translation_process/ai-playground#advanced-mode) if you are on our Business Plan. Advanced Mode helps to adjust the prompt more intricately, rather than using the toggles in the Basic tab. 

You can visit the documentation to learn more about [AI Settings](/platform/projects_and_organizations/ai-settings) and the Advanced Mode features that you can set up in the AI Settings.

## Previewing Your Prompts

You can preview your translations on [a batch or on your dataset](/platform/translation_process/ai-playground#running-prompts) to quickly check how they will look. Running in a batch will run your customized prompt on all currently filtered keys. For bigger projects, previewing on a dataset can be a better option. This means it will only be run on a select set of keys that you want to use for preview. It is done by tagging selected keys with the `ai-playground` tag and then running the preview on the dataset option.

## Glossaries

Last but not least, glossaries are also a part of the Business Plan, just like the Advanced Mode for prompting. [Glossaries](/platform/translation_process/glossaries) help you keep consistent terminology when translating. For bigger teams, this feature ensures consistency in translations.

With glossaries, the life of a translator and the reviewers becomes easier, as they will be able to see suggested translations directly on the platform without having to search through long lists every time they are unsure about translating a term. This tool improves quality and speeds up the translation process by minimizing repetitive actions. Simply hovering a mouse over a term that is in the glossary will show you the description of it, relevant tags, and suggested translation.

To learn how to set up glossaries and what other features they support, you can visit the respective [documentation page](/platform/projects_and_organizations/glossaries).

## Conclusion

Thank you for reading about these features, which hopefully will improve the quality of your translations and simplify your work. Let us know if you have any questions or suggestions. Our [Slack Community](https://tolg.ee/slack) is always open for you!
