We are very proud to share that we have released alpha versions if Tolgee Platform v3 and Tolgee JS v5. We have added
namespaces support, so you can structure your strings into smaller chunks. The base library of our JS integrations are
completely redesigned to be more lightweight end extendable by plugins.

## What's new in the Tolgee Platform v3

The most interesting feature of the new platform release is the namespaces support. Now you can select a namespace
while creating a new key, importing data or exporting data.

### The breaking changes

While adding the namespaces support, we also removed some deprecated API endpoints. So if you use those in you CI/CD
pipelines, please replace those with the `/v2` endpoints. We have removed these endpoints:

- All the endpoints matching `/api/project/**` (use `/v2/projects/*`)
- All the endpoints matching `/api/address-part/**` (use `/v2/slug/*`)
- `/v2/projects/{projectId}/import/with-streaming-response` (use `/v2/projects/{projectId}/import`)

While the `/api/project/{projectId}/export/jsonZip` is kept as the only v1 endpoint accessible with API key.


## What's new in the Tolgee JS v5

The base package of Tolgee JS `@tolgee/core` was completely redesigned and refactored to be more customizable,
be lightweight and support the namespaces feature. With this new implementation it is extremely simple to create new
plugins or new framework integrations.

## TL;DR

- The Tolgee Platform v3 and Tolgee JS v5 integrations support namespaces
- Deprecated v1 endpoints (`/api/*`) were deleted
- The JS `@tolgee/core` new JS SKDs are now lightweight, customizable and cleaner
