We are very proud to share that we have released alpha versions if Tolgee Platform v3 and Tolgee JS v5. We have added
namespaces support, so you can structure your strings into smaller chunks. The base library of our JS integrations are
completely redesigned to be more lightweight end extendable by plugins.

## What's new in the Tolgee Platform v3

The most interesting feature of the new platform release is the namespaces support. Now you can select a namespace
while creating a new key, importing data or exporting data.

### The breaking changes

While adding the namespaces support, we also removed some deprecated API endpoints. So if you use those in you CI/CD
pipelines, please replace those with the `/v2` endpoints. We have removed these endpoints:

- All the endpoints matching `/api/project/**` (use `/v2/projects/*`)
- All the endpoints matching `/api/address-part/**` (use `/v2/slug/*`)
- `/v2/projects/{projectId}/import/with-streaming-response` (use `/v2/projects/{projectId}/import`)

While the `/api/project/{projectId}/export/jsonZip` is kept as the only v1 endpoint accessible with API key.

## What's new in the Tolgee JS v5

The base package of Tolgee JS `@tolgee/core` was completely redesigned and refactored to be more customizable,
be lightweight and support the namespaces feature. With this new implementation it is extremely simple to create new
plugins or new framework integrations.

### `@tolgee/web`

We've extracted web related plugins into separated package, so `@tolgee/core` is as small as possible and ready to run in different environments (other than web).

### Unified initialization

In new integrations, tolgee is always initialized outside the actual integration and only the tolgee instance is passed down. Example in React:

```jsx
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(ReactPlugin())
  .use(FormatIcu())
  .init({
    ...
  });

export function App() {
  return (
    <TolgeeProvider tolgee={tolgee} fallback="Loading...">
      ...
    </TolgeeProvider>
  );
};
```

This way we offer you more flexibility what you can do with tolgee instance and embrace its plugin system.

### `useTranslate`, `getTranslate` changes

To properly incorporate namespace logic into tolgee, we've changed the methods for getting `t` function in Svelte, Vue and React. Now you can pass required namespace as an argument and it returns object instead of `t` function itself:

```ts
const { t, isLoading } = useTranslate('common');
```

The `t` function is automatically bind to the namespace selected in `useTranslate`. `isLoading` property tells you if the selected namespace is loaded.

### Unified `t` function interface

All the integrations now use unified `t` function interface which is now a bit different, but cleaner and more straight forward [read more](/js-sdk/5.0.0-alpha.1/api/core_package/tolgee#t).

### Usage of Suspense in React integration

React integration now uses Suspense in order to nicely implement dynamic namespaces addition. Component which would start loading new namespace through `useTranslate` will trigger suspense exception which you can catch by your `Suspense` component. If you won't catch it, it will bubble to `TolgeeProvider` and `fallback` will be shown. Suspense can be turned off:

```ts
<TolgeeProvider options={{ useSuspense: false }}>
  {...}
</TolgeeProvider>
```

## TL;DR

- The Tolgee Platform v3 and Tolgee JS v5 integrations support namespaces
- Deprecated v1 endpoints (`/api/*`) were deleted
- The JS `@tolgee/core` new JS SKDs are now lightweight, customizable and cleaner
