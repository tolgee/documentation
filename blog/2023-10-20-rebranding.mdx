## A New Look for a Bright Future

Our journey to reimagining Tolgee began with a critical examination of our interface, and the consensus was clear: our old toolbar and color scheme just didn't cut it. So, we took the opportunity to overhaul the entire application's design, creating a cohesive and contemporary user experience.

Your feedback is invaluable, and we want to thank our users for their insights. The transformation of Tolgee is a direct response to your needs, and we hope it reflects our commitment to making your localization projects smoother and more enjoyable.

### Unifying Our Brand Colors

One of the key aspects of our rebranding was unifying our brand colors. We've carefully chosen a palette that's harmonious and inviting, ensuring that every interaction with our platform is both visually pleasing and user-friendly.

### Matching Dark Mode and Light Mode

We understand the importance of choice, so we've also matched our Dark Mode to the sophistication and modern appeal of our Light Mode. Whether you prefer light or dark, Tolgee is now visually consistent, offering a seamless experience.
