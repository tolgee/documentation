After a little over 2 years, we decided to freshen up the Tolgee brand, including our logo, website and platform's user interface. We value your suggestions and want to provide the best experience for our users. So, we rolled up our sleeves and gave Tolgee a little refresh to not feel so old-school.

## A New Look for a Bright Future

We started rethinking Tolgee with a close look at our interface. It was obvious our old flashy toolbar and colors needed an upgrade. That's when we decided to redesign the whole app, aiming for a modern and user-friendly experience. We wanted to make the interface cleaner but also a little bit eye-catching with a bright pink color.

We want to thank all our users for sharing their thoughts with us. The changes in Tolgee were made with you in mind as a direct response to your suggestions. We hope these updates will make your localization projects easier and more enjoyable.

### Unifying Our Brand Colors

One of the key aspects of our rebranding was unifying our brand colors as until now we've been using different colors in light and dark mode. We've carefully chosen a palette that's harmonious and inviting, ensuring that every interaction with our platform is both visually pleasing and user-friendly.

### Matching Dark Mode and Light Mode

We understand the importance of choice (especially for developers), so we've also matched our Dark Mode to the new, cleaner Light Mode. We unified Tolgee's primary pink logo color, which is suitable for both light and dark modes.
