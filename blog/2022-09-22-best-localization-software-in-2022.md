## What is Software Localization?

Localizing your product will provide your consumers with the finest experience possible, and they will be ready to share it with others. At that moment, the success of your product is undeniable.

Software localization is the process of customizing your product to the end user's language. This involves modifications to the design and user experience of your product to make it feel more natural to your customers.

## Why Localization?

When you're marketing your items to buyers, they could feel lost and confused, when your website is in a language they don't understand. And if they don't know what you're trying to say, the odds of them buying what you're selling are small to none.

While translating your website can benefit, localizing your content — that is, delivering the same material in a different language and bending it to meet your target audience's local context – is a more successful method. You'll be able to more effectively sell your services to consumers in multiple geographical places if you have a properly customized multilingual website. This will also make you more money!

## Benefits of Localization

The following features must be included in a good localization software system:

- Most repetitious activities are automated by localization software, allowing you to focus on timely delivery.

- You can reuse parts from earlier translations thanks to translation memory features.

- Simple mistakes may be avoided thanks to built-in quality control.

- A translation memory and easy access to all project-related information help to speed up and maintain consistency in the translation process.

- Streamlined workflows reduce the time to market.

- Software localization systems allow you to do several jobs from the same workspace because of their integration features.

- With only one click, a software localization tool helps to minimize micromanagement and verifies project status and data.

## Tools for Localization of Software

## 1. Localize

It is possible to translate web pages and apps in a more efficient manner. Localize is a low-code solution for managing multilingual content for multinational companies. Simply add the Localize snippet to your website or web app and leave the rest to our software. Our file-less approach allows for easy version control and speedy communication with translators, resulting in up to a 66% reduction in turnaround time. Furthermore, the Localize platform is constantly active. Whatever changes are coming your way, we'll keep an eye out for them so you can remain up to speed on new translations with ease.

## 2. Smartling

When it comes to workflow and translation management, the Smartling TMS appears to be built towards automation. It allows you to collaborate on content across platforms and outputs. Smartling provides end-to-end translation management, allowing you to not only work on translations but also employ experienced translators, have your work rolled out to the production environment, and everything in between. Workflow management - allows you to change translation parameters, assign individuals to processes, connect with translators, and assess the performance of your translations. The basic payment is around $200 per month. There are even more advanced corporate options available, which are considerably more costly.

## 3. Tolgee

Tolgee aims to transform the software translation process with a unique technique that intends to save time and effort for everyone involved, including developers and translators.

**Simple WorkFlow**

Developers are not involved in the localization process following the development phase using Tolgee. They create the app, integrate Tolgee integration libraries, and deploy an instance that allows translators to edit localization texts in the context of a web application. The texts are then synced with the Tolgee server (REST API), and no developers are required in the localization process.

- Create your app

- Work with Tolgee

- Delegate translation responsibilities to translators.

**Tolgee Architecture**

Tolgee is made up of three components: a server (REST-API), a web application, and integration libraries. The backend service is built on a REST API. It's where your localization strings are stored and organized. It essentially acts as a business logic layer between the web application and the integration libraries. Because the web application is given and deployed with the server, it is relatively simple to set up. Integration libraries immediately use data from the REST API, so changes made in the web application are reflected in the apps you're working on at the moment.

## 4. Localazy

Another excellent option for your localization purposes is Localazy. You can simply localize your mobile, web, or desktop software using their user-friendly interface. Localazy facilitates communication and provides a complete picture of your localization project. You'll have complete control over your team members if you use contributor control. The strength of their multi-platform CLI, as well as it is Over the Air feature, will appeal to developers. To keep track of various releases, use release tags. It's easy to use, with simple settings and setup. It supports a broad number of languages, making it simple to use.

## 5. Transifex

First and foremost, you must upload content to Transifex before you can use it. The translations may then be done on the cloud. When you're finished, you may export them using an API request or a CLI command. Localization automation — on the one hand, this entails giving you access to automated translation tools, but it also entails automating the process of publishing translated material; on the other hand, it entails automating the publication process of translated content. Workflow and progress management - providing you with the tools to plan and execute a series of actions when working on translations; Translation checks, glossary lookups, and search strings are all examples of quality assurance tools. Team management - allowing for collaborative localization and transparent management of everyone's contributions. The monthly pricing plans start at $70 and are invoiced yearly.

## Closing

The scope of the project and what it will require should be the first consideration when selecting a software localization platform. I highly suggest Tolgee for long-term and complex projects, since these two products offer the most robust feature sets, broad integration, and file format support. Furthermore, Tolgee has a user-friendly interface.
