This page addresses common questions and misconceptions about the Tolgee CLI.

## Key Management and Default Values

### Q: Does the CLI detect duplicate keys with different default values?

**A: No, currently the CLI does not detect this scenario.** 

If you have the same key with different default values in your code:

```jsx
<T keyName="save-btn" defaultValue="Save" />
<T keyName="save-btn" defaultValue="Save (Changed)" />
```

The CLI will not warn you about this conflict. This is a known limitation.

**Recommended approach**: Use consistent default values across your codebase, or better yet, rely on the Tolgee Platform as the single source of truth for all translations.

### Q: Why don't default values automatically update my base language translations?

**A: This is by design to prevent conflicts between code and platform translations.**

When you first sync a key, the default value becomes the base language translation. However, subsequent changes to default values in code will not update the platform translation. This prevents situations where:

- A developer changes a default value in code
- A translator or PM has already refined the wording in the platform
- The two sources of truth conflict with each other

### Q: Can I search for strings in my code if I only store keys?

**A: This depends on your approach to translation management.**

If you follow Tolgee's recommended approach of using the platform as the single source of truth:
- You would search for keys in your code: `grep -r "save-btn" src/`
- Then look up the actual translation in the Tolgee Platform

If you maintain fallback translations in your code:
- You can search for both keys and translation strings
- But you'll need to manage consistency between code and platform

## Best Practices and Workflow

### Q: Should I keep default values in my code?

**A: Tolgee recommends against using default values as the source of truth.**

Here's why:
- **Single source of truth**: Having translations in both code and platform creates confusion
- **Team collaboration**: PMs, UX designers, and translators can update wording directly in the platform
- **Consistency**: Prevents conflicts between developer changes and translator/PM changes

**Recommended approach**: Use keys without default values, and rely on the Tolgee Platform for all translation content.

### Q: What about fallback translations for when the platform is unavailable?

**A: Use the pull command to maintain local fallback files.**

Instead of default values in code:
1. Use `tolgee pull` to download translations to local files
2. Configure your app to use these files as fallbacks
3. Keep these files in version control
4. Update them regularly via `tolgee pull`

This approach gives you:
- Reliable fallbacks without CDN dependency
- Platform as single source of truth
- Automatic updates via CLI

### Q: How do I handle the workflow where I want to update translations from code?

**A: Update translations directly in the Tolgee Platform, not in code.**

Instead of changing default values in code:
1. Update the translation in the Tolgee Platform UI
2. Use the platform's features like translation memory, suggestions, and collaboration
3. Pull the updated translations to your local files if needed

This workflow:
- Keeps the platform as the authoritative source
- Allows non-developers to manage translations
- Prevents conflicts and inconsistencies

## Technical Limitations

### Q: Will duplicate key detection be added in the future?

**A: This is a known limitation that may be addressed in future versions.**

Currently, the CLI focuses on extracting keys and syncing with the platform. Enhanced validation features like duplicate detection are being considered for future releases.

### Q: Can I force the CLI to update base language translations from default values?

**A: No, this is not supported and goes against Tolgee's recommended workflow.**

The CLI is designed to treat the platform as the authoritative source for translations. If you need to update base language translations, do so directly in the Tolgee Platform.
