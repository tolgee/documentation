title: Pushing & pulling strings
---

Pushing and pulling strings from Tolgee is the most basic way to interact with strings. Similarly as with a Git project,
it allows you to download strings from Tolgee to your computer (pull), or to upload them after you changed them (push).

## Pulling strings

This is a useful command that exports strings from the platform, and saves them in a folder of your choice. You can
use this to download strings from Tolgee before bundling your app for production.

```
tolgee pull [options]

Example usage:
   tolgee pull --path ./i18n
```

Options:

- `--path <path>` (short: `-p`) - Destination of a folder where translation files will be stored in
- `--languages <languages...>` (short: `-l`) – List of languages to pull. Leave unspecified to export all languages.
- `--states <states...>` (short: `-s`) – List of translation states to include. (choices: "UNTRANSLATED", "TRANSLATED", "REVIEWED"). Defaults to all except untranslated.
- `--delimiter [delimiter]` (short: `-d`) – Structure delimiter to use. By default, Tolgee treats `.` as a nested
  structure delimiter, and formats its export accordingly. Set the option without a value to disable this behavior.
  Can be [configured per-project](./project-configuration.mdx).
- `--namespaces <namespaces...>` (short: `-n`) - List of namespaces to pull. Defaults to all namespaces.
- `--tags <tags...>` (short: `-t`) - List of tags which to include. Keys tagged by at least one of these tags will be included.
- `--exclude-tags <tags...>` - List of tags which to exclude. Keys tagged by at least one of these tags will be excluded.
- `--support-arrays` - Export keys with array syntax (e.g. item[0]) as arrays. (default: false)
- `--empty-dir` - Empty target directory before inserting pulled files.
- `--file-structure-template <template>` - [Defines exported file structure](#file-structure-template-format)

## Pushing strings

This command allows you to upload existing strings from your local folder to the platform.

```
tolgee push [options]

Example usage:
   tolgee push --force-mode OVERRIDE
```

Options:
- `--files-template <templates...>` (short: `-ft`) - A template that describes the structure of the local files and their location with [file structure template format](#file-structure-template-format). Example: `./public/{namespace}/{languageTag}.json`
- `--force-mode <mode>` (short: `-f`) – What should we do with possible conflicts? Available modes: `OVERRIDE`, `KEEP`, `NO_FORCE` (abort on conflicts). Defaults to asking the user interactively (or `NO_FORCE` if it is not possible).
- `--override-key-descriptions` - Override existing key descriptions from local files (only relevant for some formats).
- `--convert-placeholders-to-icu` - Convert placeholders in local files to ICU format. (Default: true)
- `--languages <languages...>` (short `-l`) - Specifies which languages should be pushed (see `push.files` in config).
- `--namespaces <namespaces...>` (short `-n`) - Specifies which namespaces should be pushed (see `push.files` in config).
- `--tag-new-keys <tags...>` - Specify tags that will be added to newly created keys.
- `--remove-other-keys` - Remove keys which are not present in the import.


### File structure template format
This is a template that defines the structure of static files and mapping them to languages/namespaces.

The template is a string that can contain the following placeholders: `{namespace}`, `{languageTag}`, `{androidLanguageTag}`, `{snakeLanguageTag}`, `{extension}`.

For example, when exporting to JSON with the template `{namespace}`/`{languageTag}`.`{extension}`, the English translations of the home namespace will be stored in home/en.json.

The `{snakeLanguageTag}` placeholder is the same as `{languageTag}` but in snake case. (e.g., en_US).

The Android specific `{androidLanguageTag}` placeholder is the same as `{languageTag}` but in Android format. (e.g., en-rUS)
