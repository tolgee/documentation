The Tolgee CLI is written as a NodeJS program you can download via `npm`. You will need NodeJS version 18 or greater.
Once installed, you'll have access to the `tolgee` command globally.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      npm install --global tolgee-cli
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      yarn global add tolgee-cli
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      pnpm add --global tolgee-cli
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
You can also install the `tolgee-cli` package in the current package only. You won't benefit from the global command,
and will have to use a package script (or `npx`) to run commands.

You should make sure to save it as a dev dependency!
