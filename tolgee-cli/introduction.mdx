The Tolgee CLI is a command line utility created to make your life easier while using Tolgee, by allowing you to
easily synchronize your code project with the translation project on Tolgee.

You can find the **source code** of the CLI on [GitHub](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli).

## Best Practices

### Single Source of Truth

Tolgee recommends using the **Tolgee Platform as the single source of truth** for all translations, rather than maintaining default values in your code. This approach:

- **Prevents conflicts** between code changes and translator/PM updates
- **Enables collaboration** - non-developers can manage translations directly
- **Maintains consistency** across your entire localization workflow

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Extract keys without default values** from your code using the CLI
2. **Manage all translation content** in the Tolgee Platform
3. **Use `tolgee pull`** to download translations as local fallback files
4. **Keep fallback files in version control** for offline functionality

This workflow decouples translation content from code, allowing your team to iterate on wording without requiring code changes.

## Features

### Easy project configuration

Don't want to deal with having to type all project-specific options whenever invoking the CLI? No worries! You can
create a [`.tolgeerc` file](./project-configuration.mdx) and not have to worry about specifying all these
annoying options.

### Downloading & uploading strings

You can easily download and upload localization files using the [`pull` and `push` commands](./push-pull-strings.mdx).

Easily push new and updated strings to Tolgee when you're done working on a new feature, and automatically download all
of the strings when building your app for production. It's really this easy!

### Extracting strings from your code

One major feature of the CLI is the ability to scan your code for localization strings, and automagically extract them
for you and sync them with the localization project.

You can learn more about how it works [here](./extraction/syncing-strings.mdx).

### Tagging keys

Tag your keys according to your current production code. So you can always know which strings are currently used in `production`. Which are `deprecated` and which are `drafts` in development branches. Check the [docs here](./extraction/tagging-keys.mdx).

### Work on your self-hosted server

Not a fan of Service-as-a-Service and prefer to roll your own server? Or working locally? That's fine! You can very
easily tell the CLI to talk to your [self-hosted Tolgee server](/platform/self_hosting/getting_started).

### And more to come!

We're working on constantly improving the CLI to make it even more powerful, just like the Tolgee Platform. Any idea
for new features? We'd love to hear it! Make sure to send it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli/issues/new)
so we can start working on it.
