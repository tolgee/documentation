Tolgee supports project branching, allowing you to work on translations in isolated branches — similar to how Git branches work for code. The CLI lets you scope commands to a specific branch and manage branches directly from the terminal.

## Specifying a branch

When branching is enabled for your project, you can scope commands to a specific branch using any of these methods (from highest to lowest priority):

1. **CLI option**: `--branch <name>` (short: `-b`)
2. **Environment variable**: `TOLGEE_BRANCH`
3. **Project configuration**: `branch` field in [`.tolgeerc`](./project-configuration.mdx#branch)

The branch option applies to the following commands: `pull`, `push`, `sync`, `compare`, `tag`.

```
tolgee pull --branch my-feature --path ./i18n
TOLGEE_BRANCH=my-feature tolgee push
```

## `tolgee branch`

List, create, or delete project branches.

```
tolgee branch [branch] [options]
```

When called without arguments or options, lists all branches in the project.

Options:

- `[branch]` – Branch name to create (positional argument).
- `--create <branch>` – Create a new branch. Alternative to passing the branch name as a positional argument.
- `-d, --delete <branch>` – Delete an existing branch.
- `-o, --origin <branch>` – Origin branch to fork from. Defaults to the project's default branch.

Examples:

```bash
# List branches
tolgee branch

# Create a branch from the default branch
tolgee branch my-feature

# Create a branch from a specific origin
tolgee branch my-feature --origin develop

# Delete a branch
tolgee branch --delete my-feature
```

## `tolgee merge`

Merge a branch into its origin branch.

```
tolgee merge [branch] [options]
```

The branch to merge can be specified either as a positional argument or via the global `--branch` option.

The command previews changes before applying the merge. If there are unresolved conflicts, the merge is aborted and a link to the Tolgee web app is provided so you can resolve them there.

Options:

- `[branch]` – Branch name to merge (positional argument).

Examples:

```bash
# Merge a branch
tolgee merge my-feature

# Merge using the global --branch option
tolgee merge --branch my-feature
```
