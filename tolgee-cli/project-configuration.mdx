<Experimental/>

Rather than specifying project details every single time you run a command, you can set them once and forget about it
by creating a `.tolgeerc` file. It will be parsed as a JSON file.

## List of properties
### `projectId`
Integer. ID of the project on the Tolgee server.

### `delimiter`
Single char, or null. Structure delimiter used.

By default, Tolgee interprets `.` in string keys as nested structures. You can use another delimiter, or disable this
behavior by specifying `null`.

### `extractor`
String. Path to the [custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/how-extraction-works) to use, relative to the `.tolgeerc`
file.

By default, Tolgee uses its own internal extractor which looks for use of the [Tolgee SDK](/js-sdk).

### `apiUrl`
String. URL to the Tolgee instance you're using. If you're using Tolgee Cloud, you can ignore this.
