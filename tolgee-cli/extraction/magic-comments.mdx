title: Magic comments

In some cases, you may need to be explicit about what you want the extractor to do, because it's getting something wrong
or because of a very specific use case. Magic comments to the rescue! They're a set of directives you can add to your
code that'll explicitly tell the CLI what it should do.

## Usage

As their name implies, the magic comments are written as comments. You probably already encountered some form of them with your code
linter, or type checker.

Here is an example usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { T } from '@tolgee/react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2>
        <T keyName="section-title">My title!</T>
      </h2>
      {/* @tolgee-ignore */}
      <p>
        <T keyName="section-text">Section text!</T>
      </p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Here, the `@tolgee-ignore` directive will tell the CLI to skip parsing the next line, and it will not include it in
the extraction result. From the example above, only `section-title` would be considered a string.

## Available directives

### `@tolgee-ignore`

Ignores the next line. Keys that might be present will not be extracted and warnings, that would've been emitted, will be suppressed as well.

:::info
If the ignore directive does not have any effect, a warning will be emitted.
:::

### `@tolgee-key`

Specified a localization key. It can be written in 2 forms: simple or detailed.

The simple form just takes the key name as an argument. The detailed form takes a JSON5 object, that takes the
`keyName`, `ns`, and `defaultValue` properties.

```js
// @tolgee-key simple-key
// @tolgee-key { keyName: 'detailed-key', ns: 'my-namespace' }
```

If it is set before a key that would've been extracted, the comment supersedes what would've been extracted and
suppresses warnings that would have been emitted. Think of it as an implicit `@tolgee-ignore`.
