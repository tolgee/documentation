In some cases, you may need to be explicit about what you want the extractor to do, because it's getting something wrong
or because of a very specific use case. Magic comments to the rescue! They're a set of directives you can add to your
code that'll explicitly tell the CLI what it should do.

## Usage
As their name implies, they're written as comments. You probably already encountered some form of them with your code
linter, or type checker.

Here is an example usage:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { T } from '@tolgee/react'

export default function MyComponent () {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2><T keyName='section-title'>My title!</T></h2>
      {/* @tolgee-ignore */}
      <p><T keyName='section-text'>Section text!</T></p>
    </section>
  )
}
```

Here, the `@tolgee-ignore` directive will tell the CLI to skip parsing the next line, and it will not include it in
the extraction result. Only `section-title` would be considered a string.

## Available directives
### `@tolgee-ignore`
Ignores the next line. Keys that might be present will not be extracted and warnings that would've been emitted will
be suppressed as well.

:::info
If the ignore directive does not have any effect, a warning will be emitted.
:::

### `@tolgee-key`
Specified a localization key. It can be written in 2 forms: simple or detailed.

The simple form just takes the key name as an argument. The detailed form takes a JSON5 object, that takes the
`keyName`, `ns`, and `defaultValue` properties.

```js
// @tolgee-key simple-key
// @tolgee-key { keyName: 'detailed-key', ns: 'my-namespace' }
```

If it is set before a key that would've been extracted, the comment supersedes what would've been extracted and
suppresses warnings that would have been emitted. Think of it as an implicit `@tolgee-ignore`.
