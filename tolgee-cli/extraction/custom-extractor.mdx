You can customize the extraction process by using a custom extractor. When using this setup, instead of relying on
its own internal extractor, Tolgee will use your script (written in JavaScript) to find and extract
strings.

:::caution
When using a custom extractor, you give up on the [magic comments](./magic-comments.mdx) as it is
part of the internal extractor logic.

## Extractor structure

There is not much to know when writing a custom extractor. Here is the bare minimum file structure to follow:

```ts title=extractor.ts
import type { ExtractionResult } from '@tolgee/cli/extractor'

export default function (code: string, fileName: string): ExtractionResult {
  const foundKeys = ... // some magic code

  return {
    keys: foundKeys,
  }
}
```

## Using your custom extractor

All commands using code extraction allow you to specify a `--extractor` option which takes a path to the extraction
script to use. You can also configure it for the project via [`.tolgeerc`](../project-configuration.mdx).

:::tip
[`tolgee extract print`](./syncing-strings.mdx#dumping-all-strings) is a very helpful command to
test and troubleshoot your extractor. It will dump all the keys it found and the warnings emitted to the console.
:::

## Type definitions

Here is the type definition of `ExtractionResult`:

```ts title=extractor.d.ts
type Warning = {
  /** Warning message */
  warning: string;
  /** Line where the warning was emitted */
  line: number;
};

type Key = {
  /** Name of the key */
  keyName: string;
  /** Default value used when creating the key */
  defaultValue?: string;
  /** Namespace of the key */
  namespace?: string;
  /** Line where the key was found */
  line: number;
};

type ExtractionResult = {
  /** Keys found during the extraction */
  keys: Key[];
  /** Emitted warnings during the extraction */
  warnings?: Warning[];
};
```
