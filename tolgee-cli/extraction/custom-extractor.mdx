<Experimental/>

You can customize the extraction procedure by using a custom extractor. When using this setup, instead of relying on
its own internal extractor Tolgee will use your script (written in JavaScript or TypeScript) to find and extract
strings.

:::caution
When using a custom extractor, you give up on the [magic comments](/tolgee-cli/extraction/magic-comments) as it is
part of the internal extractor logic.
:::

## Extractor structure
There is not much to know when writing a custom extractor. Here is the bare minimum file structure to follow:

```ts title=extractor.ts
import type { ExtractionResult } from 'tolgee-cli/extractor'

export default function (code: string, fileName: string): ExtractionResult {
  const foundKeys = ... // some magic code

  return {
    keys: foundKeys,
  }
}
```

## Using your custom extractor
All commands using code extraction allow you to specify a `--extractor` option which takes a path to the extraction
script to use. You can also configure it for the project via [`.tolgeerc`](/tolgee-cli/project-configuration)

:::caution
When using TypeScript to write your extractor, you must also install `ts-node` as the CLI will use it to load the
file.
:::

:::tip
[`tolgee extractor print`](/tolgee-cli/extraction/syncing-strings#dumping-all-strings) is a very helpful command to
test and troubleshoot your extractor. I'll dump all the keys it found and the warnings emitted to the console.
:::

## Type definitions
Here is the type definition of `ExtractionResult`:
```ts title=extractor.d.ts
type Warning = {
  /** Warning message */
  warning: string
  /** Line where the warning was emitted */
  line: number
}

type Key = {
  /** Name of the key */
  keyName: string
  /** Default value used when creating the key */
  defaultValue?: string
  /** Namespace of the key */
  namespace?: string
  /** Line where the key was found */
  line: number
}

type ExtractionResult = {
  /** Keys found during the extraction */
  keys: Key[]
  /** Emitted warnings during the extraction */
  warnings?: Warning[]
}
```
