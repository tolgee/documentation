:::info
For the time being, only the React SDK is supported. See [issue #2](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli/issues/2)
:::

The code extractor is a feature of the CLI that allows you not to worry about manually finding strings and adding them
to the localization project, and leave this up to the CLI. No more stories about keys that have been forgotten!

The CLI will look through your code project and look for usage of the [Tolgee SDK](/js-sdk), and give you all the keys
used in your app. You'll then be able to push the missing keys to the platform, and deletes keys that have gone unused
to keep your localization project clean.

During analysis, the extractor will also look for [magic comments](/tolgee-cli/extraction/magic-comments) which are
basically explicit directives you can give to the extractor.

If you need to use custom logic to extract strings, we got you covered! You can use a [custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor)
and have the CLI handle the rest for you.

:::tip
Beware, glob patterns **will** conflict with your shell and **must be escaped**. If you don't wrap it as a string
(e.g. `./src/**/*.tsx` instead of `"./src/**/*.tsx"`), your shell will attempt to process the `*` tokens and you will
not have the results you're hoping for.

## Check for extraction warnings
When extracting, the CLI might not be able to fully extract strings for a variety of reasons (e.g. dynamic data). When
this happens, the CLI will emit a warning and tell you the file and line where this warning was emitted.

```
tolgee extractor check [options] '[glob of files]'

Example usage:
   tolgee extractor check './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Options:
 - `--extractor` (short: `-e`): [Custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor) to use. Leave unspecified
    to use the default internal extractor.

:::info
In the future, when running this command on GitHub Actions, it will be able to add automated review annotation warnings
directly in your commits and pull requests.

Currently, it will only emit a workflow annotation you can see on the workflow summary.

See [issue #20](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli/issues/20)

## Comparing projects
You can think of this utility as a dry-run of `tolgee sync`. You can use it to see the added/removed strings and
see if what it tells you seems right, or if it got it somehow wrong.

```
tolgee compare [options] '[glob of files]'

Example usage:
   tolgee compare './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Options:
 - `--extractor` (short: `-e`): [Custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor) to use. Leave unspecified
    to use the default internal extractor.

## Synchronizing projects
```
tolgee sync [options] '[glob of files]'

Example usage:
   tolgee sync './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Options:
 - `--extractor` (short: `-e`): [Custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor) to use. Leave unspecified
    to use the default internal extractor.
 - `--backup <path>` (short: `-B`): Optional. Path where a backup should be downloaded before performing the sync.
    If something goes wrong, the backup can be used to restore the project to its previous state.
 - `--remove-unused`: Set this flag to also remove keys from the platform that are unused.
 - `--continue-on-warning`: Set this flag to continue the sync if warnings are detected during string extraction.
    By default, as warnings may indicate an invalid extraction, the CLI will abort the sync.
 - `--yes` (short: `-Y`): Skip prompts and automatically say yes to them. You will not be asked for confirmation before
    creating/deleting keys.

## Dumping all strings
This is more of a debug command, which you can use to troubleshoot extraction issues, use as a way to test your
[custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor), ...

```
tolgee extract print [options] '[glob of files]'

Example usage:
   tolgee extract print './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Options:
 - `--extractor` (short: `-e`): [Custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/custom-extractor) to use. Leave unspecified
    to use the default internal extractor.
