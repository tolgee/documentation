Focus of version 2, was to enable new formats which are supported by Tolgee platform and make `.tolgeerc` more useful.

Tolgee configuration file now allows you to specify most of the options, that you'd have to previously set through command options.

Some options are now global:

 - `--patterns`
 - `--format`
 - `--extractor`

And they can also be defined through `.tolgeerc`.

### Changes to `push` command

This command has the most of the breaking changes. Now you **have to** specify which files you want to upload and to which language and namespace should be mapped.

Before:

```
tolgee push ./i18n
```

Now:

```
tolgee push
```

with `.tolgeerc` something like this:

```json
{
  "push": {
    "files": [
      {
        "path": "./i18n/en.json",
        "language": "en"
      },
      {
        "path": "./i18n/cs.json",
        "language": "cs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We use a new endpoint for pushing, so now it's stateless (before it was using two-step intended for the UI).

You can now tag new keys with specific tags and also delete keys which are not part of the imported files.

### Changes to `pull` command

Before:

```
tolgee pull ./i18n
```

Now:

```
tolgee pull --path ./i18n
```

Where the `path` can also now be set through `.tolgeerc`.

You now have more options for filtering.

### Commands using `patterns`

Other commands were less affected, biggest change now is that `<patterns>` is now named global option, so all commands that use it need to be changed like this (`extract check`, `compare`, `sync` and `extract print`):

Before:

```
tolgee extract check './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Now:

```
tolgee extract check --patterns './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Where the `patterns` can be defined in `.tolgeerc`
