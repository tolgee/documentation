Version 2 focuses on enabling new formats supported by the Tolgee platform, making `.tolgeerc` more useful and adding tagging operations, improving the overall reliability of the localization process.

The tolgee configuration file now allows you to specify most of the options that you'd have to set previously through command options.

Some options are now global:

 - `--patterns`
 - `--format`
 - `--extractor`

And they can also be defined through `.tolgeerc.`

### Changes to `push` command

This command has most of the breaking changes. Now, you **must** specify which files you want to upload and to which language and namespace they should be mapped.

Before:

```
tolgee push ./i18n
```

Now:

```
tolgee push
```

With `.tolgeerc` looking like this:

```json
{
  "push": {
    "files": [
      {
        "path": "./i18n/en.json",
        "language": "en"
      },
      {
        "path": "./i18n/cs.json",
        "language": "cs"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We use a new endpoint for pushing, so it's now stateless. Before, it used a statefull multi-step import endpoint, which was not optimal for CLI operations.

You can now tag new keys with specified tags and delete keys in Tolgee Platform, which are not in the imported files.

### Changes to `pull` command

Before:

```
tolgee pull ./i18n
```

Now:

```
tolgee pull --path ./i18n
```

The `path` can also now be set through `.tolgeerc`.

You now have more options for filtering.

### Commands using `patterns`

Other commands were less affected; the biggest change now is that `<patterns>` is now named a global option, so all commands that use it need to be changed like this (`extract check`, `compare`, `sync` and `extract print`):

Before:

```
tolgee extract check './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Now:

```
tolgee extract check --patterns './src/**/*.ts?(x)'
```

Where the `patterns` can be defined in `.tolgeerc`
