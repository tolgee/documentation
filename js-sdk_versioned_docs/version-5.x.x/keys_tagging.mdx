For larger projects, it might be beneficial to keep track which keys are newly created and which are already used on production.

Tolgee SDK offers a simple option to preselect a tag when creating new key through in-context UI.

```ts
tolgee.init({
  ...
  tagNewKeys: ['draft']
})
```

This will result in `draft` tag being preselected in In-context translating UI:
