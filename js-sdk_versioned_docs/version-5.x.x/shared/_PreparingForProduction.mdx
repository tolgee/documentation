Tolgee will automatically omit [`DevTools`](../api/web_package/plugins.mdx#devtools) from your bundle when you build your app for production. So it won't fetch translations directly from Tolgee Platform and it won't allow users to modify translations.

There are generally two ways how to use translations in production:

 - [Tolgee Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery) - translations are loaded dynamically from fast and reliable storage
 - [Providing localization files directly](/providing_static_data.mdx#use-localization-files-directly) - your translations are bundled with your code

**In production mode, you should never use localization data directly from Tolgee REST API**, because it can negatively affect your page performance.
