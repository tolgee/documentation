In version 5, the core library was completely redesigned. Before you start, please read the [general info about
this new version](./core.mdx).

## Initialization
In v4 the initialization of Tolgee for angular was done by passing configuration parameters to `forRoot` method. You
will need to provide a Tolgee instance using `TOLGEE_ISTANCE` injection token.

```typescript title="app.module.ts"
...
import {
  Tolgee,
  TOLGEE_INSTANCE,
} from '@tolgee/ngx';

@NgModule({
  ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: TOLGEE_INSTANCE,
      useFactory: () => {
        return Tolgee() // << The initialization of Tolgee instance is here
          .use(...)
          .use(...)
          .init({
            apiUrl: environment.tolgeeApiUrl,
            apiKey: environment.tolgeeApiKey,
            fallbackLanguage: 'en',
            defaultLanguage: 'en',
            ...
          });
      },
    },
  ],
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The initialization & configuration of Tolgee is described here.

## The Formatter
In v4, the ICU formatter was bundled with `@tolgee/core`, and used as the only formatting option. If you are already using ICU
features in your strings, you can add ICU message format support by installing `@tolgee/format-icu` and providing it to
Tolgee instance via `use()` method.

```typescript title="app.module.ts"
import { FormatIcu } from '@tolgee/format-icu';
...

// Add this to the useFactory function
return Tolgee()
  .use(FormatIcu())
  ...
```

If you only need parameter interpolation and you don't need to format advanced plurals, selects, dates, or use other cool
ICU features, you can stick with `FormatSimple` plugin, which is more lightweight. The `FormatSimple` module is included
in `@tolgee/core`, so you don't have to install it.

```typescript title="app.module.ts"
import { FormatSimple } from '@tolgee/core';

// Add this to the useFactory function
return Tolgee()
  .use(FormatSimple())
```

## Providing the localization data
If you were not using the `staticData` configuration property for providing the localization data in production, the
localization data were fetched automatically from the static assets of your app. To continue using this approach, you
need to use [`BackendFetch`](../api/web_package/plugins#backendfetch) plugin.

Suppose you are using the `staticData` property. You can continue using it the same way.

```typescript title="app.module.ts"
import { FormatSimple } from '@tolgee/core';

// Add this to the useFactory function
return Tolgee()
  .use(BackendFetch())
```

## Usage
While the T component API is still the same, the API of the translate pipe and TranslateService APIs are changed.
The `stranslate` pipe was removed and replaced with a parameter of `translate` pipe.

### The `translate` pipe

The `translate` pipe API now shares the same API as [`tolgee.t`](../api/core_package/tolgee#t). In most cases the
usage is the same, but it allows new ways of usage.

For example, you can provide all the parameters via the options object.
```html
<div>{{ { key: 'this_is_a_key', defaultValue: 'Jeeey!' } | translate}}</div>
```

### The `stranslate` pipe
The `stranslate` pipe was removed, but you can achieve the same result using `noWrap` parameter.

```html
{ 'this_is_a_key' | translate:{ noWrap: true } }}
```

### The `TranslateService` methods.

In the `TranslateService`, there is no `get` or `getSafe` method anymore. Instead, there is `translate` and `instant` method.

The `translate` method accepts the same arguments as [`tolgee.t`](../api/core_package/tolgee#t) and returns
`Observable`, emitting on every value change.

The `instant` method is similar, but returns a string value.

To switch language, you can use the `changeLanguage` method and `languageAsync` property.

```html
<select
  [value]="translateService.languageAsync | async"
  (change)="translateService.changeLanguage($event.target.value)"
  class="lang-selector">
  <option value="en">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English</option>
  <option value="de">ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutsch</option>
</select>
```
