Super light formatter, which will enable you to pass variables into translations.
It's a subset of Icu format.

## Usage

```ts
import { FormatSimple } from '@tolgee/core';

const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(FormatSimple())
  .init(...)
```

## Syntax

Passing variable:

```ts
f('Martin is {age} years old.', { age: 10 });
// Martin is 10 years old
```

You can also escape special characters by wrapping them into `'`, it works the same as in Icu standard and it only
acts like escaping character when it's followed by escapable character ("{`). It doesn't have to be closed (then all
rest of the translation is escaped).

```ts
f("This is escaped text: '{age}'");
// This is escaped text: {age}

f("This is also '{fine}");
// This is also {fine}

f("This will work 'as expected'");
// This will work 'as expected'
```

That's it! We've tried to do this format as simple as possible so the parser doesn't bloat your bundle.
If you need advanced features use [`@tolgee/format-icu`](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format) package.
