Tolgee provides an SDK for React, based on the [`@tolgee/web`](../../api/web_package/about) package. Using the SDK [@tolgee/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tolgee/react), you can connect your React application to the Tolgee platform. This SDK enables you to implement [in-context translations](../../in-context), [language detection](../../language#language-detection), interpolation, and other advanced features.

- Follow the [installation guide](./installation) to add the Tolgee React SDK to your existing React application.
- You can also check the [example application](https://github.com/tolgee/react-example) to see how to integrate Tolgee with React.
- If you are building your application with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), follow our [Next.js documentation](./next/introduction) for guidance.
- For React Native applications, view our [React Native documentation](./react_native) to learn how to use Tolgee.
