Tolgee provides an SDK for Angular, based on the [`@tolgee/web`](../../api/web_package/about) package. Using the SDK [@tolgee/ngx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tolgee/ngx), you can connect your Angular application to the Tolgee platform. This SDK enables you to implement [in-context translations](../../in-context), [language detection](../../language#language-detection), interpolation, and other advanced features.

- Follow the [installation guide](./installation) to add the Tolgee Angular SDK to your existing Angular application.
- You can also check the [example application](https://github.com/tolgee/ngx-example) to see how to integrate Tolgee with Angular.
