Tolgee provides an integration library for Svelte, based on the [`@tolgee/web`](../../api/web_package/about) package. Using the [@tolgee/svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tolgee/svelte) library, you can connect your Svelte application to the Tolgee platform. This library enables you to implement [in-context translations](../../in-context), [language detection](../../language#language-detection), interpolation, and other advanced features.

- Follow the [installation guide](./installation) to add the Tolgee Svelte integration library to your existing Svelte application.
- You can also check the [example application](https://github.com/tolgee/svelte-example) to see how to integrate Tolgee with Svelte.
