For local development, supply `apiUrl`,`apiKey` and `ui` to Tolgee configuration (see [Integration](/platform/integrations/about_integrations)). If you set everything properly, you can use in-context translating:

1.  Press and hold `Alt`/`Option` key
2.  Navigate mouse over any translation on your website
3.  It should get highlighted
4.  Click on it to open "Quick translation" dialog
5.  You can edit translations (changes will get stored to Tolgee platform)

## In-context on production

To enable in-context translating on production you can pass `apiKey` and `apiUrl` through [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin, that way Tolgee will switch to development mode (plugin will also supply `@tolgee/ui` package automatically).

:::warning
Never include `apiKey` in Tolgee configuration on production.
This property is intended only for local development, as it's not meant to be publicly visible.
:::

1.  Install [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin
2.  Go to the production version of your website
3.  Click on Tolgee Tools extension and apply your API key (you might need to reload if you just installed the plugin)
4.  In-context translating should work

#### A few notes about Tolgee Tools plugin

- You can turn off development mode by switching "Applied" toggle, which will turn it off, but stores credentials locally so you don't have to fill it again next time
- Plugin will supply `apiUrl` from Tolgee configuration if it's present (if not you can fill it manually)
- Plugin will not allow you to modify credentials if you are in development mode already
- Plugin changes its icon if Tolgee is present on the page or if credentials are set
