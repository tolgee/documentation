Rather than specifying project details every single time you run a command, you can set them once and forget about it
by creating a `.tolgeerc` file. It will be parsed as a JSON file.

:::tip
We use [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) to parse the Tolgee configuration file, which means
you aren't limited to naming it `.tolgeerc`. You can use any of the following:

- `.tolgeerc`
- `.tolgeerc.[json|yaml|yml|js|cjs]`
- `.config/tolgeerc`
- `.config/tolgeerc.[json|yaml|yml|js|cjs]`
- `tolgee.config.[js|cjs]`

You can also store your config in `package.json`, under the `tolgee` key.

## List of properties

### `projectId`

Integer or integer string (i.e. 4242 or "4242"). ID of the project on the Tolgee server.
It is shown when you first add an API key, but you can also easily find it in the URL: `app.tolgee.io/projects/{projectId}`.

### `delimiter`

Single char, or null. Used as a structure delimiter.

By default, Tolgee interprets `.` in string keys as nested structures. You can use other delimiter, or disable this
behavior by specifying `null`.

### `extractor`

String. Path to the [custom extractor](/tolgee-cli/extraction/syncing-strings) to use, relative to the `.tolgeerc`
file.

By default, Tolgee uses its own internal extractor which looks for use of the [Tolgee SDK](/js-sdk).

### `apiUrl`

String. URL to the Tolgee instance you're using. If you're using Tolgee Cloud, you can ignore this.
