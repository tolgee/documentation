Here is an overview of the basics of using the CLI.

## Command options

These options are available on all commands. They can be specified during the command execution, or configured once
in a [per-project configuration](./project-configuration.mdx).

- `--api-url <URL>` (short: `-au`) – URL of the Tolgee server. Useful for [self-hosted installations](/platform/self_hosting/getting_started). Can be [configured per-project](./project-configuration.mdx).
- `--api-key <PAT/PAK>` (short: `-ak`) – **Required**. API Key. Can be a [Personal Access Token or a Project API Key](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens).
  May be omitted if you are [logged in](#logging-in). You can also set it via the `TOLGEE_API_KEY` environment variable (recommended for CI server use).
- `--project-id <ID>` (short: `-p`) – **Required**. Project ID on the Tolgee server. May be omitted if you explicitly
  specified a Project API Key via `--api-key` or `TOLGEE_API_KEY`. Can be [configured per-project](./project-configuration.mdx).
- `--verbose` (short: `-v`) – Enables debug output.

:::tip
When dealing with options that take multiple values, we recommend you put `--` at the end of the list of option values.
For instance, let's take this command as an example:

```
tolgee some-command [options] [path]

Options:
  --languages <languages...>     List of languages
```

We recommend writing the command like so:

```
tolgee some-command --languages en cz fr -- example/path
```

This makes sure the command parser will understand what you mean without any ambiguity.

## Logging in

To interact with the Tolgee server, you need to authenticate yourself. For security reasons, the CLI doesn't use your
username/password combo, but rather Personal Access Tokens, or Project API Keys. You can learn more about these
on the [Tolgee Platform docs](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens).

To make your life easier, the CLI allows you to store authentication tokens via `tolgee login` (and remove them via
`tolgee logout`), so you don't have to specify your authentication tokens every single time.

### Saving credentials

To save your credentials, you simply need to run `tolgee login <token>`. The CLI will figure out what type of token it
is and save it appropriately. You can save multiple Project API Keys for different projects.

:::info
Here's how the CLI attempts to fetch the authentication token, from highest priority to lowest:

1. `--api-key` option
2. `TOLGEE_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Personal Access Token saved in credentials store
4. Project API Key saved in credentials store

### Using a self-hosted instance

If you are not using Tolgee Cloud, but you are running a [self-hosted instance](/platform/self_hosting/getting_started) instead, you can configure this in the [`.tolgeerc`](./project-configuration.mdx#apiUrl)
file for a whole project, or specify it when running commands via the `--api-url` flag.

When running `tolgee login` in a project configured to use a different instance, Tolgee will automatically attempt to
connect to this instance instead of Tolgee Cloud.

:::info
You can be logged into multiple Tolgee instances at the same time. Tokens are stored separately for each instance, so
you don't have to worry about conflicts.
