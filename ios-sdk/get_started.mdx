## Platform Support

| Platform | Minimum Version | 
|----------|----------------|
| iOS      | 16.0+          |
| macOS    | 13.0+          |
| tvOS     | 16.0+          |
| watchOS  | 6.0+           |

## Requirements

- **Swift:** 6.0+
- **Xcode:** 16.3+

## Adding the SDK

Add to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-swift-sdk", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or through Xcode:
1. File → Add Package Dependencies...
2. Enter: `https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-swift-sdk`
3. Choose version and add to your target

## Initialization and configuration

Initialize the SDK with your [CDN URL](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery), typically in your AppDelegate or similar startup location:

```swift
import Tolgee

let cdnURL = URL(string: "https://cdn.tolgee.io/your-project-id")!
Tolgee.shared.initialize(cdn: cdnURL)
```
:::warning

Make sure that the format for your CDN files is set to `Apple SDK` in your Tolgee project developer/cdn settings.
Learn more about [Tolgee Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery) feature.

:::

> **TIP**:
> Refer to our SwiftUI and UIKit [examples](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-swift-sdk/tree/main/Examples) for a complete setup.


You can customize the initialization with additional parameters:
```swift
// Initialize with specific language and namespaces
Tolgee.shared.initialize(
    cdn: URL(string: "https://cdn.tolgee.io/your-project-id")!,
    language: "es", // Force Spanish instead of auto-detection
    namespaces: ["buttons", "errors", "onboarding"], // Organize translations
    enableDebugLogs: true // Enable detailed logging for development
)
```

## Fetching remote translations
You have to explicitly call the `fetch` method to fetch translations from the CDN.
```swift
await Tolgee.shared.remoteFetch()
```

## Basic Translation

```swift
// Simple string translation
let title = Tolgee.shared.translate("app_title")

// Translation with arguments
let welcomeMessage = Tolgee.shared.translate("welcome_user", "John")
let itemCount = Tolgee.shared.translate("items_count", 5)
let nameAndAge = Tolgee.shared.translate("My name is %@ and I'm %lld years old", "John", 30)
```
> **NOTE:**
> Strings with multiple pluralized parameters are currently **not supported**, 
> for example `Tolgee.shared.translate("I have %lld apples and %lld oranges", 2, 3)`

## Thread-safety

Tolgee SDK is designed to be used synchronously on the main actor (except the `fetch` method). Access to the SDK from other actors generally has to be awaited.

```swift
Task.deattached {
    // notice that the call has to be awaited outside of the main actor
    let str = await Tolgee.shared.translate("key")
}
```
