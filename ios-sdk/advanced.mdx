### Custom tables/namespaces
Tolgee iOS SDK supports loading of local translations from multiple local tables by providing the `table` parameter. When using `.xcstrings` files, the names of the tables match the names of your files without the extension. You do not need to provide the table name when loading strings stored in the default `Localizable.xcstrings` file.

To have the OTA updates working properly, make sure that you have enabled namespaces for your Tolgee project and that you have created namespaces matching the names of your local tables.

```swift
// Initialize with multiple namespaces for better organization
Tolgee.shared.initialize(
    cdn: cdnURL,
    namespaces: ["common", "auth", "profile", "settings"]
)

// Use translations from specific namespaces
let commonGreeting = Tolgee.shared.translate("hello", table: "common")
// or for SwiftUI
TolgeeText("hello", table: "common")
```

## Custom bundles

You may have your strings resources stored in a dedicated XCFramework or a Swift Package.

```swift
let bundle: Bundle = ... // access the bundle

// Use the SDK directly
let commonGreeting = Tolgee.shared.translate("hello", bundle: bundle)
// or for SwiftUI
TolgeeText("hello", bundle: bundle)
```

## Listening for updates

Tolgee provides a hook to allow the consumer of the SDK to be notified about when the translation cache has been updated.

```swift
Task {
    for await _ in Tolgee.shared.onTranslationsUpdated() {
        // update your UI
    }
}
```

## Log forwarding
Tolgee allows forwarding of logs that are printed to the console by default.
You can use this feature to forward errors and other logs into your analytics.

```swift
for await logMessage in Tolgee.shared.onLogMessage() {
    // Here you can forward logs from Tolgee SDK to your analytics SDK.
}
```
