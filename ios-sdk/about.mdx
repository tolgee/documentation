description: Overview of Tolgee iOS SDK with Over‑the‑Air (OTA) localization updates and how to get started.
---

> NOTE:
> For managing static translations in your repository, consider using the [Tolgee CLI](/tolgee-cli/installation).

Tolgee iOS (and macOS) SDK makes it possible to deliver new translations from your Tolgee project directly to your application. This means you don’t need to release a new version through the App Store just to update localizations. With over-the-air updates, translations can be refreshed seamlessly in your app without requiring a manual update.

## Why use it

- __Avoid releases for copy changes__: Ship translation fixes and new languages without a new app build.
- __Faster iteration__: Product/localization teams can push improvements instantly and validate in production.
- __SwiftUI support__: You can still use features such as overwriting locales for your SwiftUI previews.
- __Resilient by default__: Works offline with caching and resource fallbacks; fewer blank strings.

## What you can do

- __Over‑the‑Air (OTA) updates__: Deliver translations via CDN (Cloud or self‑host) with caching.
- __UIKit and SwiftUI support__: with hooks for reactive updates of translations.
- __Fallbacks and preloading__: The SDK will fallback to loading a translation bundled with your app in case of any error.
- __Hosting options__: Tolgee Cloud CDN or your own CDN.
- __Works with advanced codebases__: you can still have your translations split into multiple files and have them stored in a separate framework/package.

## Demo apps

- [__SwiftUI demo__](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-swift-sdk/tree/main/Examples/TolgeeSwiftUIExample)
- [__UIKit demo__](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-mobile-swift-sdk/tree/main/Examples/TolgeeUIKitExample)

## Compatibility

The SDK currently supports iOS 16.0+ and macOS 13.0+ with integration via Swift Package Manager (SPM).

> NOTE:
> Please reach out to us if you need support for older OS versions or integration through CocoaPods, we are happy to look into it.

## Get started

- __Installation__: Install and configure the SDK — [Installation](./get_started.mdx)
- __SwiftUI compatibility__: Learn how Tolgee iOS SDK works with your SwiftUI code — [SwiftUI](./swiftui.mdx)
- __NSLocalizedString swizzling__: Learn how to achieve zero config integration by enabling method swizzling — [Swizzling](swizzling.mdx)
- __Advanced usage__: Tips and tricks for debugging and using the SDK with advanced codebases — [Advanced usage](./advanced.mdx)

## Next steps

- Install and configure the SDK: [Installation](./get_started.mdx)
