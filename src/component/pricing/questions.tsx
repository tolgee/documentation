          you'd have a total of 25 strings. Each key, whether in the original

          On self-hosted instances, the MT credits only apply to Tolgee AI

        Content Delivery allows you to set up an automated export to a reliable
        Cloud storage. You can use this storage to load translations directly to
        your application and therefore ensure that the translation fixes and
        updates will get to your users without the necessity to release a new
        version of your app.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Business and Enterprise plans you can set multiple Content Delivery
        configurations, which is useful, if you need different formats for
        different use cases.

        Custom storage allows you to configure a custom place where the
        localization files will be deployed. This storage can be configured per

        If you have provided your credit card details, you will be charged extra
        every month. The cost of seats and strings will be determined by their
        weighted average.

        <br />
        To illustrate, suppose you add an extra seat for half of the month. In
        this case, you will be charged only half the cost of the extra seat
        since the price is weighted by time.
