        <PricingQuestion question="What are strings?">
          The total amount of localization strings stored in your cloud
          organization, including strings in the base language.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are MT credits?">
          MT credits are used for Machine Translation providers (such as Google
          Translate, AWS, DeepL, etc.). One credit ‚ãç 1 translated character.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are seats?">
          The number of active users (disabled accounts are not included). When
          self-hosting, the number of users is reported to the Tolgee cloud.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Do you offer a completely free cloud plan?">
          Absolutely! When you sign up for Tolgee, you will automatically
          receive our Free plan, which is limited by the number of strings and
          MT credits.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What happens when I exceed seat or string limits?">
          <p>
            If you have provided your credit card details, you will be charged
            extra every month. The cost of seats and strings will be determined
            by their weighted average.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate, suppose you add an extra seat for half of the month.
            In this case, you will be charged only half the cost of the extra
            seat since the price is weighted by time.
          </p>
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="How do I pay for exceeding limits if I pay annually?">
          If you pay for the service annually, you may still be charged every
          month if you exceed the limits of your plan.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Does pricing change affect users who already use legacy plans?">
          <p>No. If you are using a legacy plan, you can continue to use it.</p>
          <p>This also applies to legacy free plans.</p>
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are the seats/strings limitations for the free self-hosted plan?">
          <p>
            None. The free self-hosted plan does not have seats or string
            limitations. However, you must subscribe to a paid plan to use
            advanced features like Granular permissions, CND, or Webhooks.
          </p>
        </PricingQuestion>
        <PricingQuestion question="What is the string limit for the self-hosted plans?">
          <p>
            None. We are not limiting the number of strings in the self-hosted
            instances.
          </p>
