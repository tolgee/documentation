          <p>
            If you have provided your credit card details, you will be charged
            extra every month. The cost of seats and strings will be determined
            by their weighted average.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate, suppose you add an extra seat for half of the month.
            In this case, you will only be charged half the cost of the extra
            seat since the price is weighted by time.
