        <PricingQuestion question="What are strings?">
          The total amount of localization strings stored in your cloud
          organization, including strings in the base language.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are MT credits?">
          MT credits are used for Machine Translation providers (such as Google
          Translate, AWS, DeepL, etc.). One credit ‚ãç 1 translated character.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are seats?">
          The number of active users (disabled accounts are not included). When
          self-hosting, the number of users is reported to the Tolgee cloud.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Do you offer a completely free cloud plan?">
          Absolutely! When you sign up for Tolgee, you will automatically
          receive our Free plan, which is limited by the number of strings and
          MT credits.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What happens when I exceed seat or string limits?">
          <p>
            If you have provided your credit card details, you will be charged
            extra every month. The cost of seats and strings will be determined
            by their weighted average.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, you will be charged only half the cost of the extra
            seat since the price is weighted by time.
          </p>
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="How do I pay for exceeding limits if I pay annually?">
          If you pay for the service annually, you may still be charged every
          month if you exceed the limits of your plan.
