 - The Bearer Auth (JWT Token) is used internally by the Tolgee Platform frontend. Some of the endpoints require a `Super JWT`
token, which requires two-factor authentication and is only valid for a short period of time.
 - The project API endpoints `/v2/projects/:projectId/...` can be accessed with Project API key
 - The non-project API endpoints have to be accessed with PAT (Personal access token)

The allowed authentication methods are specified for each endpoint.
