These endpoints enable you to store default settings for import. These settings are only used in the UI of Tolgee platform. It's also the default for stateful importing via `/v2/projects/{projectId}/import/*` API endpoints. The settings are stored per user and per project.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
