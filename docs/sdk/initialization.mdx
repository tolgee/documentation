Standard way to initialize tolgee is:

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee().use(DevTools()).init({
  language: 'en'
  apiUrl: 'https://app.tolgee.io'
  apiKey: '...'
})

tolgee.run();
```

:::warning
Never leak your API key! We strongly recommend against adding API key into git repository.
:::

We use `DevTools` plugin which will provide in-context translating in dev mode. We also need to provide `apiUrl` and `apiKey` for the in-context to work.

> Obtaining Tolgee API key is described in [Integration](/docs/platform/integration) chapter.

> Check all [tolgee options](./api/core_package/options) and [tolgee plugins](./api/web_package/plugins).

## What does `run` do?

:::info
In tolgee integrations `run` method is usually called automatically in tolgee provider, it is generally better to hook it into framework lifecycle because of SSR.
:::

Tolgee [`run`](./api/core_package/tolgee#run) method will start loading translations data (if necessary) and also activates in-context tools.

You can use tolgee without running it (e.g. on server with ssr). That way tolgee won't activate in-context tools and will not load anything asynchronously, but you can still use [`tolgee.t`](./api/core_package/tolgee#t) function with [`staticData`](./api/core_package/options#staticdata).
