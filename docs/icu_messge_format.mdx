## Message syntax

Plugin follows
[ICU (International Components for Unicode) message format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode).
Let's see, how to work with it.

### Providing values

The easiest example is how to include external parameters in your message.

    Hello, I am {name}.

If your parameter `name` is `John`, the output will be `Hello, I am John`.

### Plurals

Sometimes you need to specify the form of some part of the message depending on provided number value.

    {dogsCount, plural, one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}} here.

In english this is relatively easy. We need just 2 forms of the word `dog` and `be` verb. If we would like to be even cooler,
we could provide special form for 0 dogs.

    {dogsCount, plural, =0 {No dogs} one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}} here.

If we are translating into other languages, this could be much more complicated. Fortunately, it's simple to cover all
the cases. For example in Czech language we will need to cover these cases:

```
{dogsCount, plural,
=0 {Žádní psi tu nejsou}
one {Je tu jeden pes}
few {Jsou tu # psi}
other {Je tu # psů}}.
```

Notice, that you can also you tags like `few` or `many`.

All supported tags are:

```
=# (=0, =1, etc.)
zero
one (singular)
two (dual)
few (paucal)
many (also used for fractions if they have a separate class)
other (required—general plural form—also used if the language only has a single form)
```

This will cover all the cases we need. For more information about plural rules, read
[this](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).

### Selecting value

Sometimes we need to change the form of some part of translation depending on exact value match. One of these cases is
selecting proper form by gender. Again, this is something you will need in Czech language.

```
{gender, select, male {Uživatel uložil} female {Uživatelka uložila} other {Uživatel uložil}} soubor.
```

### Combining the rules

Sometimes, you would like to combine the rules. This is no problem, you can provide messages like this:

```
{gender_of_host, select,
  female {
    {num_guests, plural, offset:1
      =0 {{host} does not give a party.}
      =1 {{host} invites {guest} to her party.}
      =2 {{host} invites {guest} and one other person to her party.}
      other {{host} invites {guest} and # other people to her party.}}}
  male {
    {num_guests, plural, offset:1
      =0 {{host} does not give a party.}
      =1 {{host} invites {guest} to his party.}
      =2 {{host} invites {guest} and one other person to his party.}
      other {{host} invites {guest} and # other people to his party.}}}
  other {
    {num_guests, plural, offset:1
      =0 {{host} does not give a party.}
      =1 {{host} invites {guest} to their party.}
      =2 {{host} invites {guest} and one other person to their party.}
      other {{host} invites {guest} and # other people to their party.}}}}
```
