---

### New initialization

Icu formatter is now separated as a module and so by default Tolgee instance is without formatter. We now recommend use `Tolgee.init` instead of `new Tolgee`, which is now private. This doesn't affect majority of integrations, because Tolgee is initialized internally there, however in vanilla JS it's important.

```ts
// old way (now will give you typescript error)
import { Tolgee } from '@tolgee/core'
const tg = new Tolgee(...)

// equivalent new way
import { Tolgee, IcuFormatter } from '@tolgee/core'
const tg = Tolgee.use(IcuFormatter).init(...)

// new way without formatter
const tg = Tolgee.init(...)
```

We've changed this so it's possible to use core without IcuFormatter and therefore decrease bundle size
when we don't need it.

### `wrapperMode` setting

We now have a new way how to wrap translations.

```ts
Tolgee.init({
  ...
  wrapperMode: 'invisible' // 'text' is default
})
```

It's intended for framework integrations for the future as it uses zero-width unicode characters to identify
the translation - this way we want to reduce cases where wrapping causes problems and must be ommited.
Also this can be used with 3rd pary libraries (e.g. i18next), to preserve in-context localization functionality.
