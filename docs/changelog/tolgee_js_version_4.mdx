### Switching to invisible wrapper mode by default in integrations

All tolgee integrations now use `wrapperMode: invisible` as default.

[Text wrapper mode](/docs/web/wrapping) is still available, you can switch to it manually.

### Removing wrapping `span` in T component

As invisible wrapper mode removes issues with wrapping, we can remove it now. T component will act very similarly as t function.

### Prop `defaultValue` in Vue and Svelte integrations

Due to Vue and Svelte limitation to access children, which was causing issues, we decided to move it to props. It might be a bit less convenient, but the behavior should be more consistent.

```jsx
// before
<T keyName="key_name">Default value</T>

// after
<T keyName="key_name" defaultValue="Default value" />
```
