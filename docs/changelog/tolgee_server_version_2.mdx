## Dropping support of H2 database in favor of PostgreSQL
Since v2, H2 database is not used as default database in Tolgee Server and is replaced with embedded PostgreSQL
bundled in `tolgee/tolgee` docker image.

PostgreSQL supports a lot of features enabling us to work better with text, which is necessary for upcoming features
of Tolgee like Translation memory, Glossaries, or better search. It was unnecessary overhead to implement all the
features for both H2 and PostgreSQL, and it was slowing down the development a lot.

### Upgrade
Before upgrading to v2, you have to export all your projects and re-import them to v2. This is not going to
happen automatically.
