---

To run Tolgee server using Java, download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/releases).

:::info
Since v2, Tolgee tries to run PostgreSQL container by default.
To disable this, set `tolgee.postgres-autostart.enabled` property to `false` and provide
the [data source settings](configuration#data-source-settings) yourself.

Disabling this is **required** if you wish to run Tolgee without having Docker installed on your machine. If you leave
it enabled, Docker is required to run Tolgee.
:::

Then you can run it with:
```
java -jar tolgee-<version>.jar
```

By default, server is exposed on port 8080. To change this you can set `server.port` to different value.
```
java -jar tolgee-<version>.jar --server.port=80
```
See [configuration](configuration) page for other configuration options.

:::tip
You can specify your configuration in an `application.properties` file, next to the Tolgee server jar. The configuration
will be automatically loaded from it, which is more convenient than specifying everything as part of the run command.
