To run Tolgee server using Java download the latest release from
[github](https://github.com/tolgee/server/releases).

To run Tolgee like this, Docker has to be installed on your machine.

:::info
Since v2, Tolgee tries to run PostgreSQL container by default.
To disable this, set `tolgee.postgres-autostart.enabled` property to `false` and provide Postgres configuration yourself.
:::

Then you can run it with:
```
java -jar tolgee-<version>.jar
```

By default, server is exposed on port 8080. To change this you can set `server.port` to different value.
```
java -jar tolgee-<version>.jar --server.port=80
```
See [configuration](configuration) page for other configuration options.
