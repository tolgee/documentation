To run Polygloat server using java download the latest release from
[github](https://github.com/polygloat/server/releases).

Then you can run it with:
```
java -jar polygloat-<version>.jar
```

By default, server is exposed on port 8080. To change this you can set `server.port` to different value.
```
java -jar polygloat-<version>.jar --server.port=80
```
See [configuration](docs/running_server/configuration.mdx) page for other configuration options.
