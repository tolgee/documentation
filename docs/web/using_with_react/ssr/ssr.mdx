To use Tolgee with your SSR framework such as Next or Gatsby, you should provide localization data imported as object
using staticData property of TolgeeProvider component, so in production mode your data will be ready when your app is
rendered on server, or your static page is built from sources.

```typescript jsx
import localeEn from 'i18n/en.json';
import localeDe from 'i18n/de.json';

...

<TolgeeProvider
     staticData={{
        en: localeEn,
        de: localeDe,
      }}
...
>
...
</TolgeePrivider>
```

To get started with SSR continue with following [Next.js](./using_with_next) or Gatsby integration guides
