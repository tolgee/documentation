There are several ways how to translate a text using our React SDK. For more complex codebase showing usage
of Tolgee React integration check [React example application](https://github.com/tolgee/react-sampleapp).

To translate strings with React, you can use `<T>` component or `useTranslate` hook.

## The T component

The recommended way is the `T` component. You can use it like this:

```jsx
import {T} from "@tolgee/react";

...

<T>translation_key</T>
```

To pass values just assign parameters property.

```jsx
<T parameters={{param: "value"}}>text_with_params</T>
```

For translated text `This is {param} of the text` it will result in `This is value of the text`.

## The useTranslate hook

Another option how to translate texts is using of `useTranslate` hook. You can use it this way:
```javascript
import {useTranslate} from "@tolgee/react";

...

const t = useTranslate();

...

t("key_to_translate")
```

`t` function also accepts parameters object as second parameter:

```javascript
t("key_to_translate", {param: "value"});
```
or noWrap parameter as third parameter:
```javascript
t("key_to_translate", {}, true);
```

Without `noWrap` parameter set to true it will lead to similar result as using T component with
`strategy="TEXT_WRAP"`. The key will always be wrapped with `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix` configuration property values.
Tolgee library then finds the texts wrapped with these values and replaces it by the translated value.
Then you will be able to `ALT + click` the parent element and translate text interactively.

:::caution
If you don't have to use `useTranslate`, always use `<T>` component since it provides more flexibility, how text to translate
is handled by Tolgee.

However, sometimes there is no other way than using this hook.
For example if a component accepts just pure string as parameter then you cannot pass JSX containing T component.
:::
## The T component wrapping strategy

You can also provide a strategy prop to T component which defines how Tolgee recognizes that your DOM
is containing the text to translate.

### Strategy ELEMENT_WRAP (default and recommended)

This strategy will wrap your translated text with `<span>` element with specific data-attribute to allow Tolgee to recognize
this element as containing translation in DOM. It is the safest way of using Tolgee React SDK, since the result in
development and production mode is the same.

Consider this code:
```
<T strategy="ELEMENT_WRAP">my_cool_key</T>
```
or
```
<T>my_cool_key</T> // since ELEMENT_WRAP is default strategy
```

When translated value of `my_cool_key` is `My cool translation!`, it will be rendered to this:
```
<span data-tolgee-key-only="my_cool_key">My cool translation!</span>
```
Tolgee will then allow you to `ALT + click` the span and translate it directly.

### Strategy TEXT_WRAP

Using `TEXT_WRAP` strategy your key will be wrapped with `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix` configuration properties.
Tolgee will then find this text in DOM and replace it with translated value.

Consider this code:
```
<T strategy="TEXT_WRAP">my_cool_key</T>
```

At first, this will be rendered as `%-%tolgee:my_cool_key%-%`, but Tolgee immediately finds this text and replaces it with
"My cool translation!". It also enables you to `ALT + click` it's parent element to translate the text.

:::caution
Use TEXT_WRAP strategy just when you know what you're doing. The good reason to use this strategy is when you really
don't want the additional span wrapper rendered in your DOM, but you still want to translate the text interactively.
:::

### Strategy NO_WRAP
Using `NO_WRAP` strategy, Tolgee will just render the actual translated value. There is no way Tolgee can recognize this string as
translation in DOM, so you won't be able to translate it in context.

:::caution
Use TEXT_WRAP strategy just when you know what you're doing. NO_WRAP strategy doesn't allow you to translate text
in-context.
:::

### noWrap prop (deprecated)

The `noWrap` property is just alias for `NO_WRAP` strategy. Don't use it anymore.

```jsx
<T parameters={{param: "value"}} noWrap={true}>text_with_params</T>
```

## Message format
All Tolgee integrations follow ICU message format standard.

```{dogsCount, plural, one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}} here.```

To read more about it, check
[ICU Message Format](/docs/icu_message_format) documentation page.

All Tolgee JS integrations are using [MessageFormat class of formatJs library](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat/).
