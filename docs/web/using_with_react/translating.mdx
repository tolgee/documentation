There are several ways how to translate a text using our React integration.

## The T component

First way is the `<T>` component. You can use it like this:

```jsx
import {T} from "@tolgee/react";

...

<T>translation_key</T>
```

To pass values just assign parameters property.

```jsx
<T parameters={{param: "value"}}>text_with_params</T>
```

For translated text `This is {param} of the text` it will result in `This is value of the text`.

To skip key wrapping in translation mode use `T` component with noWrap param such as:

```jsx
<T parameters={{param: "value"}} noWrap={true}>text_with_params</T>
```

This will prevent any possible problems with Tolgee wrapping technology, but you won't be able use in-contexts
translation feature for this particular occurrence.

### Providing default value

When `keyName` property is provided, then children prop of T component is considered as default value.
```jsx
<T keyName="translation_key">This is default value.</T>
```
The default value will be rendered when no translation is provided in current nor fallback language.

## `useTranslate` hook

Other option how to translate is using of `useTranslate` hook. You can use it this way:

```javascript
import {useTranslate} from "@tolgee/react";

...

const t = useTranslate();

...

t("key_to_translate")
```

`t` function also accepts parameters object as second parameter:

```javascript
t("key_to_translate", {param: "value"});
```
or noWrap parameter as third parameter:
```javascript
t("key_to_translate", {}, true);
```

To provide default value to `t` function, use its 4th parameter.
```jsx
t("key_to_translate", {}, true, "This is also default!")
```

You can also pass props object to `t` function.
```jsx
t({
  key: "key_to_translate",
  parameters: { param: "value" },
  noWrap: false,
  defaultValue: "This is default",
})
```

## Translations with HTML tags

Our JS SDKs currently don't support rendering of HTML tags natively. However, if you really really need to render HTML tags there is a way.

This is dangerous, and you should know what you are doing.
:::

Consider a translation value:
```
'<h1>'Hello'</h1>'
```

Notice that `h1` tags are wrapped with `'` characters. This tells ICU message formatter to ignore those tags.
To get HTML you can use `t` method with `noWrap` set to `true`;

```ts
t('key_with_html_translation', undefined, noWrap) // results in: <h1>Hello</h1>
```

Nice, but React doesn't allow us to set HTML into element so easily, so we have to set it using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`,
which enables us to set inner HTML of the element.
```jsx
<div>
  data-tolgee-key-only="key_with_html_translation"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: t('key_with_html_translation', undefined, true),
  }}
></div>
```

Using `data-tolgee-key-only` we tell Tolgee, that there is a key in the element. So it will enable its in-context localization.

:::danger
Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not safe, since somebody can simply inject an HTML into a parameter. When you are
doing this you have to be sure, that your translation or params don't contain any dangerous HTML code.

TIP: Maybe you can remove tags from your translated value or parameters using [striptags library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/striptags).

## Message format
All Tolgee integrations follow ICU message format standard.

```{dogsCount, plural, one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}} here.```

To read more about it, check
[ICU Message Format](/docs/icu_message_format) documentation page.

All Tolgee JS integrations are using [MessageFormat class of formatJs library](https://formatjs.io/docs/intl-messageformat/).
