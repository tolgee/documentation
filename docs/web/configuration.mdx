All Tolgee JS integrations such as integration library for Angular or React share the same configuration properties.

## Configuration properties

### mode

There are two modes - production and development. When `apiKey` property is not provided, default mode is `production`.
When both `apiKey` and `apiUrl` properties are provided, default mode is `development`.

### apiKey
Your api key, which can be [obtained using Tolgee web application.](server_and_web_app/obtaining_api_key.mdx)

### apiUrl
Url of Tolgee server.

### inputPrefix and inputSuffix
In development mode, strings to be translated are wrapped by `@tolgee/core` library at first and then parsed and replaced with
translated value. This mechanism is called [wrapping](/docs/web/understanding_tolgee_for_web#key-and-parameters-wrapping).

`inputPrefix` is inserted before the encoded string and `inputSuffix` is inserted after the string. By those 2 strings
Tolgee recognises strings, which are meant to be translated, so its good idea to make them unique enough not to collide
with any other strings, which can appear in DOM.

Example:
```typescript
inputPrefix = '%-%tolgee:';
inputSuffix = '%-%';
```

These strings are unique enough to not clash with any other strings in your DOM, so it will not break your document.

### defaultLanguage
Default language to be set by as currentLanguage default. (default: `en`)

### fallbackLanguage
When translation is not provided in current language, Tolgee tries to find it in fallbackLanguage.
(default: value of `defaultLanguage` property)

### preloadFallback
When `true` Tolgee loads both current language and fallback language before promise is resolved from `Tolgee.run()` method.
Otherwise, Tolgee will try to load fallback language localization data just when it's needed (when some translation is missing in current language).
That way some inappropriate value may be rendered when some text is missing in current language. (default `false`)

### availableLanguages
Tolgee chooses language automatically by user's default language provided by
[browser navigator object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/language). To do so, it
needs to know which languages are available to determine whether user's preferred language is supported by your app.

If user's language is not available, `defaultLanguage` is used instead.

Default: `['en']`

### filesUrlPrefix
In production mode, localization texts are loaded from json files, which are loaded from url prefixed with this property
value.

When your current language is "en" and your `filesUrlPrefix` is `https://example.com/loc/files/`,
your localization data will be loaded from file loaded from url `https://example.com/loc/files/en.json`.

You can obtain these files by [downloading them from Tolgee Web Application](/docs/server_and_web_app/exporting_translations)

### staticData
Using this property, you can provide localization data to Tolgee as an object. Tolgee will use this data in production mode.
```typescript
import * as localeEn from 'i18n/en.json';
import * as localeDe from 'i18n/de.json';

...
const config = {
  staticData: {
        en: localeEn,
        de: localeDe,
      }
  };
```

or you can provide the data using provider functions returning promises, so it works great with dynamic import feature:
```typescript
const config = {
  staticData: {
        en: () => import('./i18n/en.json'),
        de: () => import('./i18n/de.json'),
      }
  };
```

### watch
In development mode, watch is always set to `true` because Tolgee needs to find strings to replace with translated values
every time when DOM is changed. In production mode, watching is not always necessary because integration libraries for
React and Angular return translated values directly without wrapping, so wrapped encoded strings are never inserted to DOM.

If you are not using any JS framework, and you wish Tolgee to replace wrapped encoded texts even in production mode, set
this to `true`.

`watch: true` is used in [preparing for production part](docs/web/get_started/preparing_for_production) or get started tutorial,
because this tutorial is framework independent and so no framework integration library is used.

### ui
To use Tolgee in development with in-context localization, you need to provide a constructor for UI class.

Example:
```
ui: window["@tolgee/ui"].UI,
```

`@tolgee/core` and `@tolgee/ui` are separated to reduce size of `@tolgee/core` library while `ui` library is needed just
in development mode and may be omitted in production mode.

### targetElement
Element where wrapped strings are expected in development mode. (default: `document.body`)

### tagAttributes
Tolgee is able to watch also for wrapped localization strings in attributes of DOM elements. These attributes must be
specified in these configuration properties.

Default:
```javascript
tagAttributes: {
    textarea: ['placeholder'],
    input: ['value', 'placeholder'],
    img: ['alt'],
    '*': ['aria-label', 'title'],
}
```

### highlightKeys
By default, in development mode, when you move mouse over an element containing translated text and key `ALT` is down,
this element is highlighted by changing its background color. To modify the key use `highlightKeys` property.

Example:

```javascript
import {ModifierKey} from "../clients/js/packages/core/lib/index";

...

    highlightKeys: [ModifierKey.Shift, ModifierKey.Alt]
```

Default: `[ModifierKey.Alt]`


### passToParent
There are elements which can contain wrapped string to be translated, but user is not able to click on them. For example
an option of `select` HTML element cannot be used for capturing click even with `ALT` down. For these reasons you can
configure Tolgee to "pass" these strings to parent and listen for click events on the parent.

Default: `["option", "optgroup"]`


### restrictedElement
Array of elements in which you don't want Tolgee to replace wrapped strings.

Default: `['script', 'style']`

### highlightColor
Background color of highlighted element.

Default: `rgb(224 240 255)`&nbsp;&nbsp;<div style={{
backgroundColor: "rgb(224 240 255)",
width: "20px",
height: "20px",
display: "inline-block",
verticalAlign: "middle"
}}></div>
