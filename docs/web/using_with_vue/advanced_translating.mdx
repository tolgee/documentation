To make in-context localization work, we need a way to identify translations on the page
and find their parent DOM element to attach event listeners.

In case of [`T`](./api#t-component) component we simply wrap the translation with `span`. This has an advantage,
that every translation is uniquely identifiable, but there might be cases, where you really need to only render
text. You can switch this off through property [`strategy="NO_WRAP"`](./api#prop-strategy). This has the drawback, that in-context translation
won't work in this case.

```html
<T keyName="translation_key" strategy="NO_WRAP" />
```

## [`$t`](./api#function-t) function wrapping

[`$t`](./api#function-t) function is a bit more complicated, because we cannot attach our own html element into the DOM.
So in this case the function is returning Tolgee custom made [wrapping](../wrapping),
which is then captured by DOM [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) and that will find suitable parent element, where the translation gets
registred and so in-context localization can work there. In production mode, this whole logic can be omitted and [`$t`](./api#function-t) function
returns only the translated string.

This can be problematic in cases where you put translation outside of DOM document, because then the change is not
picked up by the DOM observer. You can do that with [`noWrap`](./api#parameter-nowrap) parameter.

Here is example how to set document title:

```ts
export default {
  mixins: [TolgeeMixin],
  created() {
    document.title = this.$t({ key: 'page_title', noWrap: true });
  },
  beforeUpdate() {
    document.title = this.$t({ key: 'page_title', noWrap: true });
  },
};
```
