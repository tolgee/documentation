Using Tolgee provides great features which help you to produce perfectly localized web apps to your users. However, sometimes
you can get to some trouble while using it. To be able to shoot those troubles, you have to understand the base principles
of Tolgee and be prepared to use translation methods in more advanced way.

## T component strategies
To achieve the ability to translate texts in context, Tolgee should be able to determine which elements in DOM contain
the translated localization keys and to be able to change them dynamically. To enable this, there are several
strategies to use `T` component with.

### `ELEMENT_WRAP` strategy (default and recommended)
Using `ElEMENT_WRAP` strategy, Tolgee Svelte SDK will wrap your translated text with `<span>` element with
`data-tolgee-key-only` attribute. Elements marked with this attribute can be found in the DOM and handled by Tolgee.
```svelte
<T keyName="key">...</T>
// or
<T keyName="key" strategy="ELEMENT_WRAP">...</T>
```

This will result in this to be rendered in DOM when the key `key` is translated to value `Translated` for the current language.

```html
<span data-tolgee-key-only="key">Translated</span>
```

Like this Tolgee finds out, that this element contains key named `key` and enables the in-context translation.

### `TEXT_WRAP` strategy
When you don't want Tolgee to wrap your string with `<span>` element, you can use `TEXT_WRAP` strategy. Tolgee will wrap
encoded key, params and default value with prefix and suffix, configurable in config property of [`TolgeeProvider`](/docs/web/using_with_svelte/api#tolgeeprovider) component.
(See [configuration doc page](/docs/web/configuration))

This code:
```
<T keyName="key" parameters={{key: "value", key2: "value2"}} strategy="TEXT_WRAP" />
```

This will be rendered to DOM in **development** mode:
```
%-%tolgee:key:key:value,key2:value2%-%
```

However, in development mode, Tolgee listens to changes of DOM using
[MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) and replaces all strings like this
with the translated values. Even in specific attributes like `placeholder` of `<input>` or `aria-label` of any element.

In **production** mode, the rendered result will be
```
Translated
```
when the key is translated to value `Translated` for the current language.

To read more about wrapping, see [Understanding Tolgee for Web doc page](/docs/web/understanding_tolgee_for_web).

### `NO_WRAP` strategy (not recommended)
The most simple strategy is `NO_WRAP` strategy. With this strategy, the translated text will be rendered directly without
any wrapping.

:::caution
When using `NO_WRAP` strategy, you won't be able to translate strings in-context since Tolgee have no way to find out
that the string is translation.
:::

This code:
```svelte
<T keyName="key" strategy="NO_WRAP" />
```
Will be rendered to:

```
Translated
```

## `noWrap` parameter of `t` function
Since `t` function has to return string, by default it works similarly to `T` component with strategy set to `TEXT_WRAP`.
By default, it does the text wrapping described above.

So this code:
```svelte
<script>
  import { getTranslate } from "@tolgee/svelte";

  const t = getTranslate();
</script>

{$t({ key: "key", noWrap: false })}
// or
{$t({ key: "key" })}
```

Will produce this result rendered into DOM in **development** mode:
```
%-%tolgee:key%-%
```

Again, in development mode, Tolgee listens to changes in DOM using
[MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) and replaces all strings like this
with the translated values. Even in specific attributes like `placeholder` of `<input>` or `aria-label` of any element.

In **production mode**, the rendered result will be
```
Translated
```
when the key is translated to value `Translated` for the current language.

### When `noWrap = true`
When noWrap parameter is set to true, the t function returns directly the translated value. So it works the same as `T` component with
strategy set to `NO_WRAP`.

This code:
```svelte
<script>
  import { getTranslate } from "@tolgee/svelte";

  const t = getTranslate();
</script>

{$t({ key: "key", noWrap: true })}
```

Will be (in both development and production mode) rendered to:
```
Translated
```
