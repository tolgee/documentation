Tolgee offers two ways of wrapping, you can configure this through [wrapperMode](/docs/web/configuration#wrappermode).

## Text wrapping

In development mode Tolgee wraps every key and it's params into a specific format unless noWrap parameter is true.
```
<inputPrefix><translationKey>,[<defaultValue>]:[<param1>:<value1>,...,,<paramN>:<valueN>]<inputSuffix>
```

For example:
```javascript
tolgee.instant("peter_has_n_dogs", {dogsCount: "5"});
```
returns:
```
%-%tolgee:peter_has_n_dogs:dogsCount:5%-%
```
when `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix` configuration properties are default.

Tolgee is then able to find this wrapped string in DOM and replace it with `Peter has 5 dogs`. It also stores
its metadata in suitable parent element and makes it clickable to allow in-context localization.

## Invisible wrapping

Since version 3.0 we introduced invisible wrapping, which uses unicode zero width characters.
This method is intended only for framework integrations and basically just adds a invisible mark to each translation,
which is then picked up and translation is registered in parent element, so in-context can work properly
([blog post](/blog/2021/12/17/invisible-characters-for-better-localization)).
This only applies to development mode. In production mode no special characters are added.
