To work with Tolgee properly you should be familiar with basic Tolgee concepts.

## Modes

Tolgee works in two modes: development and production.

### Development mode
Users who access the page in development mode can change localization texts in the context of the page.
To achieve this, Tolgee needs to identify which text in
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
should be translated. Tolgee checks specific DOM subtree on every change
(using [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)) and looks for
translatable strings in the page. To read more about how Tolgee handles this, read [Wrapping](wrapping) doc page.

Tolgee is in development mode when credentials (`apiUrl` + `apiKey`) are defined and valid.

### Production mode
On the contrary in production mode, `translate` and `instant` methods return the translated text directly.
Tolgee is unable to change the occurrences anymore. When language changes, you should
rerender every translated text manually. However, our integrations for React, Angular, and other frameworks handle
this out of the box.
