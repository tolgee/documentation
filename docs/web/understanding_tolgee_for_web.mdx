To work with Tolgee properly you should be familiar with basic Tolgee concepts.

## Modes

Tolgee works in two modes: development and production.

### Development mode
Users who access the page in development mode are able to change localization texts in context of the page.
To achieve this, Tolgee needs to identify which text in [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
should be translated. Tolgee basically checks specific DOM subtree on every change and looks for translation keys
wrapped in strings provided by configuration properties `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix`. This is the reason why wrapped keys
and params are returned from `translate` and `instant` functions in development mode.

### Production mode
On the contrary in production mode, `translate` and `instant` methods return the translated text directly.
Tolgee is unable to change the occurrences anymore. When language changes, you should
rerender every translated text manually. However, our integrations for React and Angular handle this out of the box.
