Tolgee can be used in any web application. It is completely framework independent. There are prepared packages for
React and Angular. But first of all, let's look on simple application without any framework.

Check out our [example application on github](https://github.com/tolgee/window-example)

Let's start with simple html code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
There is text `Hello world!` in the body, which we would like to translate.

Loading Tolgee in your web application is as simple as including one dependency. To do so, we can simply use unpkg
repository:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tolgee/core/dist/tolgee.umd.min.js"></script>
```

To translate your content interactively, you will need one more dependency.
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tolgee/ui/dist/tolgee-ui.umd.min.js"></script>
```
This dependency is Tolgee's UI, so dialog can appear when you **ALT + click** your translation.

Now it's time to configure the library. To do so, just pass configuration object as first parameter of Tolgee constructor.
```html
<script>
const pg = new window["@tolgee/core"].Tolgee({
    apiUrl: "https://app.tolgee.io",
    apiKey: "you_secret_api_key",
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true,
    ui: window["@tolgee/ui"].UI,
});
</script>
```
In configuration object you can specify many other parameters, but in this example we stick with:
- **apiUrl** - url of the api, where we are saving the data
- **apiKey** - which you can obtain in the [app](https://app.tolgee.io) or in your self-hosted app by following
[this documentation page](server_and_web_app/obtaining_api_key.mdx)
- **inputPrefix** - character sequence which appears before the text you wish to translate
- **inputSuffix** - character sequence which appears after the text you wish to translate
- **watch** - parameter defining whether Tolgee should watch for changes in the DOM and update translations
- **ui** - constructor of Tolgee's UI to render interactive translation modal window

Afterwards you create the instance you need to replace the text **Hello world!** with localization key wrapped
with your `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix`.

```html
<body>
    <h1>{{hello_world}}</h1>
</body>
```

Finally, lets run the beast!

```javascript
pg.run().then(() => {})
```

You should end with this HTML document:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{hello_world}}</h1>
</body>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tolgee/core/dist/tolgee.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tolgee/ui/dist/tolgee-ui.umd.min.js"></script>
<script>
const pg = new window["@tolgee/core"].Tolgee({
    apiUrl: "https://app.tolgee.io",
    apiKey: "you_secret_api_key",
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true,
    ui: window["@tolgee/ui"].UI,
});
pg.run().then(() => {
    // This block is executed after tolgee loads it's translation.
    // So here you have nice possibility to remove your loading overlay
})
</script>
</html>
```
After opening this document in a browser you should be able to `ALT + click` your text and translate it directly.
After that you should see your translated version right away!
