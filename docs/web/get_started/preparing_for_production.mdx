In production environment, you should never leak your API key. In-context localization must be available only for your translators,
 developers or other staff but not for the outside world.

:::warning

Never leak your API key! We strongly recommend against adding API key into git repository.

:::

To prepare your application for production you will need to let Tolgee use exported .json files.
You can get these files by exporting your translations from web application.
See [exporting translations](server_and_web_app/exporting_translations.mdx).

To make Tolgee look for json files just remove **apiKey** property from configuration object. If we continue with
our [hello world example](hello_world), production configuration object will look like this:
```javascript
{
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true
}
```

In production mode, `apiUrl` and `ui` properties are useless as we don't allow anybody to change our translations in
the app accessible from the outside world. We can also remove the `script` tag importing tolgee UI.

Next, we should add exported translations into some public path so Tolgee can reach them.
By default, Tolgee looks for the translation files in `/i18n/[lang].json`.
To change this, you may provide `filesUrlPrefix` property to configuration object but for out example we can stick with
default.

Let's take the exported json files and put them into the i18n directory placed as a sibling of our html file:
```
├── i18n
│   ├── cs.json
│   └── en.json
├── index.html
```

That's it! Our app is ready for production. Here is the final HTML page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{hello_world}}</h1>
</body>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tolgee/core/dist/tolgee.umd.min.js"></script>
<script>
const { Tolgee, IcuFormatter } = window["@tolgee/core"]
const tg = Tolgee.use(IcuFormatter).init({
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true,
});
tg.run();
</script>
</html>
```
Now you maybe wish to [add loading overlay](adding_loading_overlay.mdx) to make untranslated texts invisible.
