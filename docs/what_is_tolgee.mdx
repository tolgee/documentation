Localization used to be just so ineffective. The whole management process of creating, managing, and fixing localization strings
is sometimes very complicated and involves developers much more than is actually needed.

Tolgee aims to reshape the process of software localization with a different approach, which saves time and
the effort of everyone who is involved such as developers, translators, and others.

## Easy workflow

With Tolgee, developers are not involved in the localization process after the process of development itself. They develop
the app and integrate Tolgee integration libraries. That's it. Translators can change the localization
texts in the Tolgee Platform or in the context of the product. Texts are then synchronized with Tolgee Platform and there
is no need for developers to be part of the localization process anymore.

1. Develop your app
2. Integrate Tolgee
3. Let translators do their job

## Features

### Simple localization texts management

With Tolgee, you can manage localization texts in simple UI. UI is like a joke. When you have to explain it,
it isn't good. Following this philosophy, we are keeping our UI as clean and simple as we can.

### Ready for different environments

You can [deploy Tolgee on your local machine](/docs/platform/self_hosting/running_with_docker#running-it-locally)
and use it for your local localization management, you can
[deploy it on your cloud infrastructure](/docs/platform/self_hosting/running_with_docker#running-with-compose),
or you can use [Tolgee Cloud](https://app.tolgee.io).

### In-context localization for web

With Tolgee integrated into your web application, you can use our in-context localization feature, so
you can just click & translate the text. This feature can actually save a lot of time for communication between
translators and developers. In most cases, translators can change the texts directly in the app and see what it
looks like, so any issues such as typos or broken layout can be solved immediately.

## Tolgee architecture

Tolgee consists of Tolgee Platform and integration libraries (SDKs).

The platform is where the strings are stored and where users can manage them all in one place.

Integration libraries are using data provided by REST API directly, so texts changed in the web application are propagated
into applications, you currently develop.

## Get started

To get started, Sign up for the [Tolgee Cloud](https://app.tolgee.io) or learn how to
[self-host](/docs/platform/self_hosting/running_with_docker#running-with-compose) Tolgee,
or read [integration docs](https://tolgee.io/integrations/all).
