Apple Strings and Stringsdict are used to localize strings in Apple platforms. The format is currently deprecated.
However, we still recommend using it in favor of XLIFF since this Strings and Stringsdict gives you
better control over the strings and their translations.

The `.strings` file is used to store simple strings, while `.stringsdict` is used to store only the plural values.

Example of a Strings file:
```
/*
  Localizable.strings
*/

/* This is a comment */
"welcome_header_%@" = "Hello, %@";

/* This is a comment */
"user_settings_password_label" = "Password";
```

Example of a Stringsdict file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>what-a-key-plural_%lld</key>
    <dict>
      <key>NSStringLocalizedFormatKey</key>
      <string>%#@format@</string>
      <key>format</key>
      <dict>
        <key>NSStringFormatSpecTypeKey</key>
        <string>NSStringPluralRuleType</string>
        <key>NSStringFormatValueTypeKey</key>
        <string>lld</string>
        <key>one</key>
        <string>Peter has one dog</string>
        <key>other</key>
        <string>Peter hase %lld dogs</string>
      </dict>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

We recommend using the semantic keys format as in the examples above. That enables you to change the base values without
modifying the actual key and doesn't suggest keeping the keys in sync with the base language translation.
