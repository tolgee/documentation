Tolgee supports various formats, which you can use with different programming languages frameworks or technologies.
You can import data and export data to formats listed below.

Before you start with working with imports and export, you should get familiar with the concept of [Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).

## Tolgee native JSON

Json format is native for Tolgee [JS SDKs](/js-sdk). In the native JSON, we use ICU message format. When importing to or importing
from nothing is converted, and the [ICU message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format)
is usually preserved (except from special plural cases). [Read mode](json).

## XLIFF

XLIFF format is a standard format for translation exchange. It is widely used in the industry. For XLIFF format
we preserve the [ICU message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format)
as stored in Tolgee. [Read more](xliff).
