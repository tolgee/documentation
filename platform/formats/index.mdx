Tolgee supports various formats, which you can use with different programming languages, frameworks or technologies.
You can import data and export data to the formats listed below.

Before you start working with imports and exports, you should get familiar with the concept of [Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).

:::info
Support for most of the formats below was added in  **v3.49.0**. If you are using an older version, please update.
:::

## Tolgee native JSON

JSON format is native for Tolgee [JS SDKs](/js-sdk). In the native JSON, we use the ICU message format. When importing to or importing
from, nothing is converted, and the [ICU message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format)
is usually preserved (except in special plural cases). [Read more](./native_json).

## Structured JSON

Structured JSON is also a simple JSON file format with no additional data like comments, but it can be structured, and eventually, you can use it with array support. [Read more](./structured_json).

## XLIFF

XLIFF format is a standard format for translation exchange. It is widely used in the industry. For XLIFF format,
we preserve the [ICU message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format)
as stored in Tolgee. [Read more](xliff).

## Apple Strings (.strings, .stringsdict)

Apple strings format is used in Apple platforms. It is used for localization of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
We **recommend using this** since it's currently the most flexible format for Apple platforms. Using `.strings` &
`.stringsdict`. You can also modify the base translation values. [Read more](apple_strings).

## Apple Xliff (.xliff)

Apple Xliff format is a specific format for translation exchange, and it's convenient for translators using other platforms.
However, Apple is very strict while importing data from `.xliff` back, so it's not possible to modify the base strings
with this format. Because of that, we recommend going with `.strings` & `.stringsdict` if you can. [Read more](apple_xliff).

## Apple String Catalog (.xcstrings)
We currently don't support importing/exporting String Catalog `.xcstrings` directly, but you can translate String Catalogs via
`.xliff` import/export. [Read more](apple_xliff).

## Android resources XML (.xml)

Android resources XML format is used for localization of Android applications.
We support all the features of the format, including plurals and arrays [Read more](android_resources_xml).

## Flutter (.arb)

Flutter .arb format is used for localization of Flutter applications. It is a JSON-based format with a specific structure.
With Tolgee, you're able to import and export .arb files. [Read more](flutter_arb).

## Gettext (.po)

Tolgee currently supports `.po` files with C/C++, PHP and Python sprintf message formats. Both import/export are supported.
If enabled, `sprinf` placeholders from such message formats can be converted to
[Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders) and
vice versa when exporting. [Read more](gettext).


## Properties (.properties)

Java properties format is used mostly for the localization of Java applications, especially Spring-based apps.
It is a simple key-value format. For this format, we preserve the
[ICU message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format), so you are able to format messages with
Java [MessageFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html) class.
[Read more](java_properties).
