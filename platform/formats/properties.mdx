`.properties` files are usually used to store configuration & localization data for Java applications. To read more about
the Java Resource Bundle localization,
see the [official Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html).

*note: As of Java 9, the default encoding for `.properties` files is UTF-8. So we export the data with UTF-8.*

In `.properties` files, we preserve the [ICU Message format](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format) so you can
simply format you messages with [Java MessageFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html) class.

Tolgee doesn't support arrays or nesting in the `.properties` files.

## Example of a `.properties` file

```properties
# Password field label in the user settings form
user-settings.password.label = Password
dogs_count = {count, plural, one {One dog} other {# dogs}}
```

As visible in the example, the .properties file stores key-value pairs.
also imports and exports the comment as a key description.

import Importing from './components/_general_importing.mdx';
