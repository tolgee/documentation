## The MessageFormat and placeholder conversion
When importing data to Tolgee from the `.strings` and `.stringsdict` files, you can either enable or disable the
conversion to the Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders. The conversion is enabled by default. You can also disable the
conversion globally in project settings by disabling the `Use Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders` option.
[Read more about benefits of Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/translation_process/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).

When the conversion is disabled, the original placeholders like `%llm`, `%@` etc. are preserved.

### Placeholder conversion specification

The apple documentation about format specifiers can be found
[here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Strings/Articles/formatSpecifiers.html).

Only specifiers specified in the table below are supported. Tolgee doesn't support additional flags and modifiers and
placeholders using them are not converted.

import { PlaceholderConversion } from "../../src/component/docs/formats/PlaceholderConversions";

<PlaceholderConversion data={[
  {
    specifier: "%",
    icuType: "N/A",
    example: "%%",
    exampleConverted: "%",
    note: "%% is the way how to render %, in ICU we don't have such concept, so we just add %. When exporting the % is not converted back to %%."
  },
  {
    specifier: "@",
    icuType: "none",
    example: "%@",
    exampleConverted: "{0}",
  },
  {
    specifier: "lld",
    icuType: "number",
    example: "%lld",
    exampleConverted: "{0, number}",
  },
  {
    specifier: "f",
    icuType: "number, [precision string]",
    example: "%f",
    exampleConverted: "{0, number, 0.000000}",
    note: "By default %f uses 6 decimal places, that's why we convert it to the number with such precision. " +
      "%.2 f would be {0, number, 0.00} and so on."
  },
  {
    original: "%e",
    example: "{0, number, scientific}",
    note: "%E is not supported"
  }
]} originalName="Apple placeholder" target="original"/>

If your placeholder is not supported, you can use `%@` and format the string yourself in the code.

Apple also supports `n$` positional specifiers. There are converted to as well as the zero based argument index. E.g.
`I am %2$@, and I have %1$lld dogs.` is converted to `I am {1} and I have {0, number} dogs`.

## Exporting
When exporting the data back to the .po file, the placeholders are converted back to the original format.
