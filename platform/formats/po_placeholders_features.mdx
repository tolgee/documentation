Tolgee converts the placeholders to the [Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders)
when enabled.

## Feature support
Tolgee supports importing of basic `msgid` and `msgstr` fields, the plural `msgid_plural` and `msgstr[..]` arrays and it
imports the `extracted comments` (`#.`) as the key descriptions. No other fields are supported.
