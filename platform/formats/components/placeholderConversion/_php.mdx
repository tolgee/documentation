In the PHP world, strings are often formatted using the `sprinf` function.
This format is standard for PHP localization using [Gettext (.po)](/platform/formats/po).
The official PHP documentation can be found
[here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php)

Only specifiers specified in the table below are supported. Tolgee doesn't support additional flags and modifiers and
placeholders using them are not converted.

import {
  BaseSprintfPlaceholderConversions
