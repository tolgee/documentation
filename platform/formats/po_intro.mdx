The .po file format, short for Portable Object, is a form of text file used in software development
for translating interface text. Originating from the GNU gettext localization method,
this open-source standard is widely used to make applications available in multiple languages.
In the .po file, each original text string and its translation are grouped to aid automated translation
of software content.

For .po files, Tolgee fully supports the plurals and uses `extracted comments` as the key descriptions. To read more about
the .po file format, you can visit the [GNU gettext documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html).
