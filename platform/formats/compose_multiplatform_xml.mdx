Compose Multiplatform Resources XML files (usually found in
`composeResources/values/{languageCode}.xml`) can be used to store localization (i18n) data.
It is similar to Android Resources XML files but has some specific differences
in escaping and placeholder handling. It supports plurals and arrays.
To read more about using resources in your Compose Multiplatform application in general,
read the [official Compose Multiplatform documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-resources.html#set-up-a-project-with-multiplatform-resources).

## Example
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="user_settings_password_label">
      Password
    </string>
    <plurals name="dogs_count">
        <item quantity="one">%1$d dog</item>
        <item quantity="other">%1$d dogs</item>
    </plurals>
    <string-array name="string_array">
        <item>First item</item>
        <item>Second item</item>
    </string-array>
</resources>
```

## File structure
The Compose Multiplatform Resources XML file is an XML-based file.
When used for storing translations, it can contain these elements:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
- **resources**
    - the root element of the file.
- **string**
    - a simple string value.
- **plurals**
    - a string that has different forms based on the quantity
    - attributes:
        - **quantity**: the plural keyword

          Possible keywords: `zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, `other`.

          Get the full list of the keywords for each language [here](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/44/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).

## The MessageFormat and placeholder conversion
When importing data to Tolgee from the Compose Multiplatform XML files, you can turn the
conversion to the Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders on or off. The conversion is enabled by default. You can also turn off the
conversion globally in project settings by disabling the `Use Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders` option. We recommend
keeping the conversion enabled, as it brings many benefits.
[Read more about the benefits of Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/translation_process/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).

When the conversion is disabled, the original placeholders like `%1$s`, `%1$d` etc. are preserved.

### Placeholder conversion specification

import JavaPlaceholders from './components/placeholderConversion/_java.mdx'

<JavaPlaceholders />

## Exporting
When exporting the data back to the .xml file, the placeholders are converted back to the original format.

## Array support
When importing data to Tolgee from the Compose Multiplatform XML files, the array elements are converted into flat keys with
`arrayName[index]` format.

For example, the following XML:
```xml
<resources>
 <string-array name="string_array">
        <item>First item</item>
        <item>Second item</item>
 </string-array>
</resources>
```

will be imported to Tolgee as

```json
{
  "string_array[0]": "First item",
  "string_array[1]": "Second item"
}
```

and vice versa when exporting from Tolgee to the Compose Multiplatform Resources XML file.

Since the `[` and `]` characters are not allowed in the key names in the Compose Multiplatform Resources XML files,
there should be no conflicts if you use the Tolgee project only for the Compose Multiplatform app. Otherwise, remember that keys named
with the described syntax are converted to arrays.

## Strings wrapped with CDATA
When Tolgee imports the Compose Multiplatform Resources XML file, it extracts the strings from the CDATA sections. e.g.
`<string><![CDATA[Hello]]></string>` is imported as `Hello`. Keys with imported translations with CDATA-wrapped values
are marked with `_androidWrapWithCdata` [custom value](/platform/translation_keys/custom_values) (this is for legacy reasons as the Android format was
the first to introduce the CDATA wrapping). When exporting, keys marked with `_androidWrapWithCdata` are wrapped with CDATA.

Tolgee does this because its primary goal is to enable users to use the same translation data on multiple platforms
(e.g., Web, Android, Apple). So we have to strip all the additional syntax, which is removed by the XML Resources parser.

However, when Tolgee removes this syntax, without the `androidWrapWithCdata` custom value, it wouldn't be able to build
the Resources XML resource file without possibly breaking the App.

## Escaping
When importing data Tolgee unescapes escaped backslash `\\`, new line `\n` and tab (`\t`) characters. When exporting,
these characters are escaped back. e.g. `\\` is imported as `\` etc. Other characters (e.g. escaped unicode characters like `\u0020`) are not unescaped.

## Importing keys with tags
Unless the string is wrapped with CDATA, all tags are removed when importing data to Tolgee to match
the functionality of the default `stringResource` function.

## Tags and Placeholders
When the value contains XML tags and placeholders at the same time, it's always wrapped with CDATA when exported.
