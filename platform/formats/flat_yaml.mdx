Flat YAML is a simple key-value YAML. When exporting in this format, you can choose from various placeholder & message formats listed below.

import { FormatList } from "../../src/component/docs/formats/FormatLinks";

<FormatList formats={["ICU", "JAVA_STRING_FORMAT", "PHP_SPRINTF", "C_SPRINTF"]} />

Read more about [message & placeholder formats here.](./message_placeholder_format.mdx)

## Example

This is an example of .yaml file.

```yaml title="en.yaml"
"user-settings.password.save.button": "Save"
"interpolated_key": "Hello, {name}!"
"plural_key": "You have {count, plural, one {one message} other {# messages}}."
```

Flat YAML doesn't support nesting or array support. We recommend using flat YAML in favor of
Structured YAML because there is no space for confusion as with structured YAML.
If you need support for nesting or arrays, go ahead with [structured YAML](structured_yaml.mdx).

## Format specification

In flat YAML format, we store data as a flat YAML object, so the keys are not nested and all the keys
are on the first level of the root YAML object.

The keys in the YAML are localization keys, e.g.
`user-settings.password.save.button`, and the values are the translated strings, e.g.,
`Save`, as you can see in the example. Keys, including dots or array indexes, are not converted to nested objects.

## The message format and placeholder conversion
import {
  GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion
} from "../../src/component/docs/formats/GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion";

<GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion formatName="Flat YAML"
                                        placeholderExamples={<><code>%s</code>, <code>%d</code></>} />

## Exporting via REST API

To export to Tolgee Native YAML via REST API, you have to set the following parameters:

```
{
  "format": "YAML",
  "supportArrays": "false",
  "structureDelimiter": ""
}
```

Example with CURL:
```
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export?\
format=YAML\
&structureDelimiter=\
&supportArrays=false" -H "X-API-Key: <Your Project API key>" --output data.zip
```
