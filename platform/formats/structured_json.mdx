Structured JSON format is a generic format enabling you to export translations to JSON files with array support.
When exporting in this format, you can choose from various placeholder & message formats listed below.

import { FormatList } from "../../src/component/docs/formats/FormatLinks";

<FormatList formats={["ICU", "JAVA_STRING_FORMAT", "PHP_SPRINTF", "C_SPRINTF", "RUBY_SPRINTF"]} />

Read more about [message & placeholder formats here.](./message_placeholder_format.mdx)

In general, we recommend against using structured JSON because it can lead to unexpected behavior, as explained below.

Example of structured JSON:

```json title="en.json"
{
  "user": {
    "settings": {
      "password": {
        "save": {
          "button": "Save"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When importing such JSON, the nested elements are converted into flat keys. So, the example above will be imported the same way as this one:

```json title="en.json"
{
  "user.settings.password.save.button": "Save"
}
```

## The message format and placeholder conversion
import {
  GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion
} from "../../src/component/docs/formats/GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion";

<GenericMessageAndPlaceholderConversion formatName="Structured JSON"
                                        placeholderExamples={<><code>%s</code>, <code>%d</code></>} />

### Support for arrays

In some cases, you might want to use arrays in your JSON. This is useful when you want to have a list of items, for example.

```json title="en.json"
{
  "items": [
    "First item",
    "Second item",
    "Third item"
  ]
}
```

When importing such JSON, the array will be converted into flat keys with index suffixes. So, the example above will be imported the same way as this one:

```json title="en.json"
{
  "items[0]": "First item",
  "items[1]": "Second item",
  "items[2]": "Third item"
}
```

### Key naming issues when using structured JSON (import)

Imagine this structured JSON to be imported to Tolgee:

```json title="en.json"
{
  "user": {
    "password": "Password"
  },
  "user.password": "Set your password"
}
```

Both keys are translated into the same key, `user.password`. In this case, Tolgee will only import the first key and
ignore the second one while a warning is displayed.

import { ScreenshotWrapper } from "../shared/_ScreenshotWrapper";

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/formats/json_import_conflict_warning.webp" alt="Import warning" />

A very similar situation can happen when using arrays:

```json title="en.json"
{
  "user": [
    "Password"
  ],
  "user[0]": "Set your password"
}
```

Again, the same key `user[0]` is translated into two different values. In this case, Tolgee will only import the first
one. So the value for `user[0]` will be `Password`.

### Key naming issues when using structured JSON (export)

Very similar issues can happen when exporting structured JSON. Imagine these keys stored in the Tolgee platform:

```json
{
 "user.password": "Password",
 "user": "User"
}
```

Tolgee cannot export this to structured JSON because the key `user` is used once as a key for the string value user, and once
as a key for the nested object.

```json title="INVALID JSON (key user is used twice)"
{
 "user": { // <--- This is a problem
   "password": "Password"
 },
 "user": "User" // <--- This is a problem
}
```

In such cases, Tolgee joins the last two path elements of the key. So the export will look like this:

```json title="en.json"
{
 "user.password": "Password",
 "user": "User"
}
```

While this works perfectly fine for Tolgee JS SKDs, it might be an issue for other tools.

For arrays, this issue is handled differently. When the required array index is already occupied, Tolgee will try to
use another one.

Let's say you have these keys stored in Tolgee:

```json
{
 "item[0]": "Text",
 "item[0].hey": "Text"
}
```

Such results will be exported like this when array support is enabled:
```json
{
  "item" : [ "Text", {
    "hey" : "Text"
  } ]
}
```

### Exporting via REST API
To export to Tolgee Native JSON via REST API, you have to set the following parameters:
```json
{
  "format": "JSON",
  "supportArrays": "true",
  "structureDelimiter": "."
}
```

Example with CURL:
```bash
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export?\
format=JSON\
&structureDelimiter=.\
&supportArrays=true" -H "X-API-Key: <Your Project API key>" --output data.zip
```
