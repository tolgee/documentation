## Account security

The Account security page allows you to change your password and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
2FA is a security feature that requires you to enter a code in addition to your password when you log in. This code is generated by an app on your phone. **We recommend enabling 2FA** to protect your account.

### Two-Factor Authentication

To enable 2FA, click the `Enable 2FA` button. You will be prompted to enter your password and a code generated by an app on your phone. After you confirm to enable 2FA, recovery codes will be generated. **Write down these codes and keep them in a safe place**. You will need them if you lose access to your phone.
