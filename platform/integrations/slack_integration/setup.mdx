### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Tolgee account with the necessary permissions to manage integrations.
- A Slack workspace where you have permission to add apps.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Install the Tolgee App in Slack

Install Slack application from [Slack App Directory](https://slack.com/apps/dumbLink) by clicking on the **Add to Slack** button. Or you can find app right in Slack by
opening the Apps > Add apps at your workspace and searching for "**Tolgee**", and then click **Add**.

#### Step 2: Connect Slack workspace with your Tolgee account
After installing the Tolgee app, you can interact with it either as a personal app or within a channel. Once the app is installed in the workspace, it will be available in all public channels.
For private channels, you need to invite the Tolgee app manually by using the command `/invite @tolgee`.
Now you need to link your Tolgee account with the Slack workspace. You can do that by typing `/tolgee login`.
