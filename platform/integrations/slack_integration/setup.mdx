## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Tolgee account with the necessary permissions to manage integrations
- A Slack workspace where you have permission to add apps

:::info Feature availability

Tolgee Slack Integration is available in the Business and Enterprise plans. [Upgrade your plan](https://tolgee.io/pricing) to use this feature.

If you use the self-hosted version, you need to [set up the license](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) to use this feature.

## Step 1: Install the Tolgee App in Slack

First of all you need to install the Tolgee app in your Slack workspace. You can do that right via our web app:

1. Open [Tolgee Platform](https://app.tolgee.io/) (login if you are not already)
2. Click on your icon in the right top corner and go to **Organization Settings**.
3. Then navigate to **Apps**.
4. Now you will see all available apps. Click on **Connect To Slack** button in the **Slack** app.

After that follow the prompts to authorize Tolgee app to access your Slack workspace just by clicking **Allow**

:::info Info

The first step must be done by the **organization owner**. The second step must be done by any user to access the commands.

After installing the Tolgee app, you can interact with it either as a personal app or within a channel. Once the app is installed in the workspace, it will be available in all public channels.
For private channels, you need to invite the Tolgee app manually by using the command `/invite @Tolgee`.

## Step 2: Connect your Slack account with your Tolgee account

Now you need to link your Tolgee account with your Slack account. We need this to identify you and provide you with the necessary permissions.
Here is how you can do that:
1. Type `/tolgee login` in the chat room to which the Tolgee app is invited.
2. Button **Connect Tolgee account** will appear in the chat.

3. Click on it and you will be redirected to the Tolgee login page.

4. Then click **Link Accounts**.

After login you will see a success message in the chat.

Now you can use the Tolgee app in your Slack workspace.

# Self-hosting

You can also use the Tolgee Slack integration with the self-hosted version of Tolgee. Your setup will be a bit different.
 You need to need to create your own Slack and then configure the Tolgee app to use your self-hosted Tolgee instance.
To learn more refer to the [Self-hosting documentation](/platform/self_hosting/slack_integration_self_hosted).
