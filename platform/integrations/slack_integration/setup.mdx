## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Tolgee account with the necessary permissions to manage integrations
- A Slack workspace where you have permission to add apps

:::info Feature availability

## Setup for Cloud Users

### Step 1: Install the Tolgee App in Slack

First of all you need to install the Tolgee app in your Slack workspace. You can do that right via our web app:

1. Open your [Tolgee Project](https://app.tolgee.io/projects) (login if you are not already)
2. Click on your icon in the right top corner.
3. Then navigate to **Apps**.
4. Now you will see all available apps. Click on **Connect To Slack** button in the **Slack** app.

After that follow the prompts to authorize Tolgee app to access your Slack workspace just by clicking **Allow**

:::info Info

The first step must be done by the **organization owner**. The second step must be done by any user to access the commands.

### Step 2: Connect Slack workspace with your Tolgee account
After installing the Tolgee app, you can interact with it either as a personal app or within a channel. Once the app is installed in the workspace, it will be available in all public channels.
For private channels, you need to invite the Tolgee app manually by using the command `/invite @Tolgee`.


Now you need to link your Tolgee account with the Slack workspace:
1. Type `/tolgee login` in the chat room to which the Tolgee app is invited.
2. Button **Connect Tolgee account** will appear in the chat.

3. Click on it and you will be redirected to the Tolgee login page.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/slack_integration/tolgee_login.png" />

4. Then click **Link Accounts**.

After login you will see a success message in the chat.

Now you can use the Tolgee app in your Slack workspace.


## Setup For Self-Hosted Users

If you are using the self-hosted version of Tolgee, you also can use the Slack integration. The setup is a bit different than for cloud users.

### Step 1: Create and Install the Tolgee App in Slack

First of all you need to create a new app in your Slack workspace. You can do that by navigating to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
and clicking on **Create New App**. To know more about creating an app in Slack, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://api.slack.com/quickstart).
After creation, you need to install the app in your workspace:

1. Navigate to your app **Basic information** page
2. Click on **Install to Workspace** button

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/slack_integration/install_self_host.png" />


### Step 2: Configure the App

Now you need to provide all necessary tokens. First of all provide `signing-secret`.

1. Go to the **Basic information** page of your app and find the **Signing Secret**.
2. Navigate to your Tolgee instance and open `application.yaml` file.
3. Add the following configuration:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
    signing-secret: <signing-secret>
```

Your next step depends on whether you are using the Slack with single workspace or with multiple workspaces.
In most cases self-hosted instances don't need to connect to multiple slack workspaces.

#### Single Workspace

1. First you need to provide all necessary bot Scopes. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** page and add the following scopes:
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.customize`
   - `commands`
   - `groups:history`
   - `groups:read`
   - `im:history`
   - `im:read`
   - `mpim:history`
   - `mpim:read`
   - `users:read`

2. Then reinstall the app in your workspace by clicking on **Reinstall App** button. This is necessary to apply the new scopes.
Now you can copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**. It starts with `xoxb-`.

3. Now you need to provide the token to your Tolgee instance. Navigate to your Tolgee instance and open `application.yaml` file.
Add the following configuration:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
    bot-token: <your-bot-token>
```

#### Multiple Workspace

1. Get `client-id` and `client-secret` from the **Basic information** page of your app.

2. Provide client-id and client-secret in `application.yaml` file of your Tolgee instance:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
   client-id: <your-client-id>
   client-secret: <your-client-secret>
```

3. Setup Redirect URL in the **OAuth & Permissions** page of your app. Click on **Add New Redirect URL** and set
it to public frontend URL e.g. `https://tolgee-frontend-<name>`

4. Setup Redirect URL in the **Event Subscriptions** page . Enable events if not enabled and set a request URL to backend path /v2/public/slack/on-bot-event e.g.
 `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack/on-bot-event`

5. Add event `app_uninstalled` in the **Event Subscriptions** page. For that navigate to **Subscribe to bot events** section and add the event.

### Step 3: Configure Slash commands

You need to add your own slash commands to your app.

1. Navigate to **Slash Commands** in Slack API App Dashboard.
2. Click on **Create New Command** button.
3. Fill in the form with the following values:
   - Command: `/tolgee`
   - Request URL: The backend `/v2/public/slack` endpoint url. E.g., `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack`

### Step 3: Configure Interactivity & Shortcuts

1. Go to **Interactivity & Shortcuts** page of your app.
2. Set Interactivity *request url* to /v2/public/slack/on-event backend endpoint. E.g., `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack/on-event`
