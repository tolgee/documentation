# Usage

This guide will help you subscribe to project updates, manage your notifications, and more. Whether you're a project manager, developer, or translator,
 Tolgee's Slack integration offers a seamless way to streamline your workflow and collaborate more efficiently with your team. :rocket:

## Subscribe to a Project

Subscribe to a project to receive notifications for all events and languages in the project.

``
/tolgee subscribe $project_id
``

After subscribing, you will receive notifications on key creation, and translation update events.

## Advanced Subscription Options

### Language Subscription

You can subscribe to notifications for a specific language within a project. This allows you to receive updates only
for translations in that language. Here's how to do it:

``
/tolgee subscribe 1 fr
``

This command subscribes you to French translations in project 1.

:::info
You need to know tag of the language you want to subscribe to.
You can find the tag in the language settings in the Tolgee web app.

### Event Subscription

You can also subscribe to notifications for specific events within a project. These events include the creation of new keys,
changes to the base text, or changes to translations. Here's how to subscribe to events:

``
/tolgee subscribe $project_id --on [event]
``

- new_key - receive notifications only when a new key is created
- base_changed - receive notifications when the base text is changed
- translation_changed - receive notifications when a translation is changed
- all - receive notifications for all events

For example, to subscribe to new key events in project 1 for French translations:

``
/tolgee subscribe 1 fr --on new_key
``

That's it! You're now equipped to manage your project notifications effectively using the Tolgee bot in Slack.

## Unsubscribe from a Project

If you no longer wish to receive notifications for a particular project, you can unsubscribe using this command:

``
/tolgee unsubscribe $project_id $language_tag(optional)
``

You can optionally include a language tag to unsubscribe from notifications for a specific language within the project.

## Show Subscriptions

To view a list of all your current subscriptions, use the following command:

``
/tolgee subscriptions
``

It will display a list of all your subscriptions, including the project ID, language tag, and events you are subscribed to.

## Account Management
### Connect Tolgee to Slack
To get started with Tolgee and begin receiving notifications in Slack, you'll need to connect your Tolgee account to Slack.
This simple process can be initiated using the
``
/tolgee login
``
command, which prompts you to authorize Tolgee's access to your Slack workspace.
More about this in the [Setup](setup) section.

### Logout
If you ever need to disconnect your Tolgee account from Slack or switch accounts, you can easily log out using the
``
/tolgee logout
``
command. This ensures that your account remains secure and that you have full control over your integration settings.
