## Installing the plugin

First, you need to install the plugin from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/2757e202f8f3408bbf66f65d26223398) and add it to your project/engine.

Alternatively, you can clone the plugin from [GitHub](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-unreal) and compile it locally.

## Enabling the plugin

To enable the Tolgee plugin inside Unreal, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Toolbar `Edit` menu
1. Open the `Plugins` windows
1. Find the Tolgee plugin and tick the checkbox next to it
1. Press `Restart now` or restart your project manually

## Setting up the plugin

After installing and enabling the plugin, you need to set the following properties in the Project Settings → Localization → Tolgee section:

1. Set the **API key**

  If you don't have one, you can check out our documentation on [how to generate an API key](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens#generation).

2. Set the **API URL**

  If you are using the self-hosted version, you can change the URL to your instance.

3. Adjust *Languages*

  By default, the Unreal plugin pulls all the languages defined in your Tolgee project. However, if you want to use other localization methods for a certain language, you can remove it from the list.
