## Setting up the plugin

After installing the plugin, you need to enable it and set the following properties in the Project Settings → Localization → Tolgee section:

### Set the API key

If you don't have one, you can check out our documentation on [how to generate an API key](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens#generation).

### Set the Endpoint URL

If you are using the self-hosted version, you can change the URL to your instance.
