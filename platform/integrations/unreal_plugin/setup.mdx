## Setting up the plugin

After installing the plugin, you need to enable it and set the following properties in the Project Settings → Localization → Tolgee section:

### Set the API key

If you don't have one, you can check out our documentation on [how to generate an API key](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens#generation).

### Set the endpoint URL

### Set Project Id

This is the unique id associated with your project on the Tolgee platform, you can get this from your web dashboard URL. (e.g.: `https://app.tolgee.io/projects/1840` is the URL of Project Id `1840`)
