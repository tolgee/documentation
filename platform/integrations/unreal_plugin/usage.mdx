description: In the following sections, we will cover how to connect Unreal Engine Localization Dashboard to the Tolgee Localization Provider
---

## Localization setup in Unreal Engine

Tolgee is now fully supported as a **native Localization Provider** for the Unreal Engine Localization Dashboard.

If you are unfamiliar with localization in Unreal Engine, we highly encourage you to check out the following resources:

- [Unreal Engine Localization Tools documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/localization-tools-in-unreal-engine)
- [Unreal Engine Localization In-Depth](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/zwPJ/unreal-engine-localization-in-depth)

If you have not configured the Tolgee Provider yet, go through the [Setup](/platform/integrations/unreal_plugin/setup) first.

## Working with the Tolgee Localization Provider

To make the initial push (or to update it after creating/deleting/updating keys):

1. Run Unreal's `Gather Text` followed by `Tolgee Push`
2. Go inside the Tolgee web dashboard and translate
3. Run `Tolgee Pull` to get the latest data from your dashboard

## Data sources breakdown

When using the Tolgee Unreal Engine plugin, translation data can be pulled from multiple places:

### Unreal Localization Dashboard

- **Servers:** static data
    - can only be updated using the `Tolgee Pull` button mentioned above
    - requires re-packaging the game to update

- **Available:** both in-editor and packaged games

- **Best for:** when keys are added/removed from the project

### Content Delivery Network

- **Servers:** dynamic data
    - fetched at runtime during start-up from [Tolgee Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery) and dynamically injected
    - updated over the air without re-packaging

- **Available:** both in-editor and packaged games

- **Best for:** patching translation without risks to production

### Tolgee Web Dashboard

- **Servers:** dynamic data
    - fetched at runtime during startup from the [Web Dashboard](/platform/projects_and_organizations/editing_translations) directly and dynamically injected
    - updated over the air without re-packaging

- **Available:** only in-editor

- **Best for:** faster local development

:::info
`Content Delivery Network` and `Tolgee Web Dashboard` cannot be used at the same time for Play-in-Editor sessions. Toggling between them is done via `Use Cdn in Editor`. Configuring the settings for each is explained below.

## Settings

### Tolgee Runtime Settings

:::warning
These settings will be packaged with the final game and are saved as **plain text** in the project.

`Cdn Addresses`: List of web addresses the plugin will query to fetch dynamic translations at the game start.

`Use Cdn in Editor`: If enabled, Play-in-editor Sessions will use dynamic data from the CDN. Otherwise, data from the Web Dashboard will be queried.

### Tolgee Editor Settings

:::warning
These settings will **NOT** be packaged with the final game, but they are saved as **plain text** in the project.

The `Api Key`, `Api Url` and the entire `Provider` section are programmatically controlled when they are configured via the Unreal Localization Dashboard. So you don't have to worry about setting them manually.

`In-Context` → `Project Ids`: List of Tolgee Project Ids the plugin will query to fetch dynamic translations constantly.

`In-Context` → `Refresh Interval`: How often (in seconds) we will check the above project ids for updates.

## Tolgee Menu

After enabling the Tolgee plugin and restarting the editor, the Tolgee icon should be visible in the upper right corner toolbar.

### Tolgee Tab – In Context Translations

The best part of the Tolgee plugin is the **Tolgee Tab**.

After logging into your Tolgee account, hovering over any unformatted localized string will open a browser window containing the matching key inside Tolgee.

You can directly update the translation, hit save and if you have the settings configured, the text will be updated while the game is running.
