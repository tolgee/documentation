description: 'Learn how to connect your AI assistant to Tolgee via the MCP server.'
---

## Prerequisites

- A Tolgee account (cloud or self-hosted)
- A **Project API key (PAK)** or a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** — see [API keys and PAT tokens](/platform/account_settings/api_keys_and_pat_tokens)
- An MCP-compatible AI client

:::info
**PAK vs PAT** — A Project API key is scoped to a single project, so you don't need to specify `projectId` in every request. A Personal Access Token gives access to all projects you have permissions for, but you must pass `projectId` explicitly when calling project-scoped tools.

## Claude Desktop / Claude Code

Add the following to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tolgee": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://app.tolgee.io/mcp/developer",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "<your_PAK_or_PAT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or using the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http tolgee https://app.tolgee.io/mcp/developer \
  --header "X-API-Key: <your_PAK_or_PAT>"
```

## Cursor

Open **Settings > MCP** and add a new server with the HTTP transport pointing to `https://app.tolgee.io/mcp/developer`. Pass your token via the `X-API-Key` header.

## Verifying the Connection

After configuring your client, try a read-only command to confirm everything works:

> **You:** List my Tolgee projects

If the connection is successful, the AI assistant will return a list of projects accessible with your token.

:::info
For self-hosted instances, replace `https://app.tolgee.io` with your own Tolgee server URL.
