## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. Tolgee's MCP server lets you manage your localization projects directly from AI-powered tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT, and others.

Instead of switching between your IDE and the Tolgee UI, you can ask your AI assistant to list keys, update translations, trigger machine translation, and more — all through natural language.

## Available Roles

The MCP server currently exposes a single role-based endpoint:

| Role | Endpoint | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Developer** | `/mcp/developer` | Full access to keys, translations, languages, tags, namespaces, branches, and batch operations. |

More roles (e.g. translator, project manager) are planned for future releases.

## How to Get Started

1. Follow the [setup guide](/platform/integrations/mcp_server/setup) to connect your AI client to Tolgee.
2. Check the [usage guide](/platform/integrations/mcp_server/usage) for example workflows and best practices.
