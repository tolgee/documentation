## Setup For Self-Hosted Users

If you are using the self-hosted version of Tolgee, you also can use the Slack integration. The setup is a bit different than for cloud users.

### 1. Create and Install the Tolgee App in Slack

First of all you need to create a new app in your Slack workspace. You can do that by navigating to [Slack Apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps)
and clicking on **Create New App**. To know more about creating an app in Slack, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://api.slack.com/quickstart).
After creation, you need to install the app in your workspace:

1. Navigate to your app **Basic information** page
2. Click on **Install to Workspace** button

### 2. Configure the App

Now you need to provide all necessary tokens. First of all provide `signing-secret`.

1. Go to the **Basic information** page of your app and find the **Signing Secret**.
2. Navigate to your Tolgee instance and open `application.yaml` file.
3. Add the following configuration:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
    signing-secret: <signing-secret>
```

Now you need to provide all necessary bot Scopes:

1. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** page and add the following scopes:
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.customize`
   - `commands`
   - `groups:history`
   - `groups:read`
   - `im:history`
   - `im:read`
   - `mpim:history`
   - `mpim:read`
   - `users:read`

2. Then reinstall the app in your workspace by clicking on **Reinstall App** button. This is necessary to apply the new scopes.

After that, you need to provide the bot token, client-id, and client-secret. Follow these steps:

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions** and find section **Bot User OAuth Token**. Token starts with `xoxb-`.

2. Now you need to provide the token to your Tolgee instance. Navigate to your Tolgee instance and open `application.yaml` file.
Add the following configuration:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
    bot-token: <your-bot-token>
```

3. Get `client-id` and `client-secret` from the **Basic information** page of your app.

4. Provide client-id and client-secret in `application.yaml` file of your Tolgee instance:
```yaml
tolgee:
 slack:
   client-id: <your-client-id>
   client-secret: <your-client-secret>
```

When you have all the necessary tokens, you need to configure URLs in Slack app:

1. Setup Redirect URL in the **OAuth & Permissions** page of your app. Click on **Add New Redirect URL** and set
it to public frontend URL e.g. `https://tolgee-frontend-<name>`

2. Setup Redirect URL in the **Event Subscriptions** page . Enable events if not enabled and set a request URL to backend path /v2/public/slack/on-bot-event e.g.
 `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack/on-bot-event`

3. Add event `app_uninstalled` in the **Event Subscriptions** page. For that navigate to **Subscribe to bot events** section and add the event.

### 3. Configure Slash commands

You need to add your own slash commands to your app.

1. Navigate to **Slash Commands** in Slack Apps Dashboard.
2. Click on **Create New Command** button.
3. Fill in the form with the following values:
   - Command: `/tolgee`
   - Request URL: The backend `/v2/public/slack` endpoint url. E.g., `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack`

### 4. Configure Interactivity & Shortcuts

1. Go to **Interactivity & Shortcuts** page of your app.
2. Set Interactivity *request url* to /v2/public/slack/on-event backend endpoint. E.g., `https://tolgee-backend-<name>/v2/public/slack/on-event`
