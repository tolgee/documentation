import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


As the Server is based on Spring framework, it follows its configuration standards. You can configure Tolgee by providing
a configuration file, provide configuration properties as command line arguments when you run Tolgee with `java -jar` command, or as environment variables.

Example configuration files:

<Tabs lazy groupId="config-format" queryString defaultValue='yaml' values={[{"value":"yaml","label":"YAML"},{"value":"env","label":".env"},{"value":"properties","label":"application.properties"}]}>
<TabItem value="yaml">
import ExampleYamlConfig from "./shared/_exampleYamlConfig.mdx";

<ExampleYamlConfig />
## Server settings \{#server}

  :::tip
  Once set, you don't need to set this property anymore, and it is recommended you unset it so the password is not stored in plaintext in config files.
  
  If you set this field to something else, the initial user's password will be updated **unless the password was updated once via the Tolgee web UI**.
  :::
  
  

- ##### `initial-username` \{#tolgee-authentication-_-initial-username}

  URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens

#### Per-Organization Single Sign-On \{#tolgee-authentication-_-sso-organizations}

Prefix: `tolgee.authentication.sso-organizations`

To use SSO in Tolgee, can either configure global SSO settings in `sso-global` section or in the per Organization mode by setting the `enable` to `true` in this section and configuring it separately for each organization in the organization settings.

There is a significant difference between global and per organization SSO: Global SSO can handle authentication for all server users no matter which organizations they belong to, while per organization SSO can handle authentication only for users of the organization and such users cannot be members of any other organization. SSO users associated with per organization SSO have no rights to create or manage organizations. Global SSO users should be invited to organizations they need to have access to. Per organization SSO users are automatically added to the organization they belong to.

Prefix: `tolgee.batch`

Configuration of batch operations.

- ##### `cancellation-timeout-ms` \{#tolgee-batch-_-cancellation-timeout-ms}

- ##### `max-per-mt-job-concurrency` \{#tolgee-batch-_-max-per-mt-job-concurrency}

  Concurrency among all tolgee instances per one machine translation job
  .Higher concurrency provides faster and distributed processing, but can lead to hitting rate limit
  on OpenAI, as well as getting over the limit of availableCredits: at the beginning, we only check, that
  the organization has `availableCredits > 0` and only when we have the result from OpenAI,we are able to
  calculate how many credits to charge the organization. In the Tolgee Cloud it is set to 1.  (default: `-1` Unlimited (within tolgee.batch.concurrency))

- ##### `use-redis` \{#tolgee-cache-_-use-redis}

  Whether Tolgee should use Redis to store cache data instead of storing it in-memory.
  :::info
  In a distributed environment, you **should** use a Redis server to ensure consistent enforcement of rate limits, as
  they heavily rely on cache. For a simple single-node deployment, in-memory cache is sufficient.
  :::
  
  :::info
  Tolgee uses [Redisson](https://github.com/redisson/redisson) to interface with the Redis server. You can find the properties Redisson expects [here](https://github.com/redisson/redisson/tree/56ea7f5/redisson-spring-boot-starter#2-add-settings-into-applicationsettings-file).

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. To use SSO in Tolgee, can either configure global SSO settings in this section or in refer to `sso-organizations` section for enabling the per Organization mode.

There is a significant difference between global and per organization SSO: Global SSO can handle authentication for all server users no matter which organizations they belong to, while per organization SSO can handle authentication only for users of the organization and such users cannot be members of any other organization. SSO users associated with per organization SSO have no rights to create or manage organizations. Global SSO users should be invited to organizations they need to have access to. Per organization SSO users are automatically added to the organization they belong to.
