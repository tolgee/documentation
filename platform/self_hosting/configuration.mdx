As the Server is based on Spring framework, it follows its configuration standards. You can configure Tolgee by providing
a configuration file, provide configuration properties as command line arguments when you run Tolgee with `java -jar` command, or as environment variables.

Example configuration files:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs lazy groupId="config-format" queryString values={[{"value":"yaml","label":"YAML","displayOption":"kebab-case"},{"value":"env","label":".env","displayOption":"snake-upper-case"},{"value":"properties","label":"application.properties","displayOption":"kebab-case"}]}>

<TabItem value="yaml">

import ExampleYamlConfig from "./shared/_exampleYamlConfig.mdx";

<ExampleYamlConfig />

## Server settings

## Spring settings

Prefix: `spring`

These properties are used to configure Spring framework.

### Data source settings

Prefix: `spring.datasource`

Since Tolgee is built on Spring framework, you have to edit following configuration props
to configure its database connection. These properties can be omitted when using
[Postgres autostart](#postgres-autostart), which is enabled by default.

- ##### `url` \{#url}

  The url of the datasource in format `jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<dbname>`. e.g. `jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres`

- ##### `username` \{#username}

  :::tip
  Once set, you don't need to set this property anymore, and it is recommended you unset it so the password is not stored in plaintext in config files.
  
  If you set this field to something else, the initial user's password will be updated **unless the password was updated once via the Tolgee web UI**.
  :::
  
  

- ##### `initial-username` \{#initial-username}

- ##### `token-uri` \{#token-uri}

  URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens

#### Per-Organization Single Sign-On

Prefix: `tolgee.authentication.sso-organizations`

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. To use SSO in Tolgee, can either configure global SSO settings in `sso-global` section or in the per Organization mode by setting the `enable` to `true` in this section and configuring it separately for each organization in the organization settings.

There is a significant difference between global and per organization SSO: Global SSO can handle authentication for all server users no matter which organizations they belong to, while per organization SSO can handle authentication only for users of the organization and such users cannot be members of any other organization. SSO users associated with per organization SSO have no rights to create or manage organizations. Global SSO users should be invited to organizations they need to have access to. Per organization SSO users are automatically added to the organization they belong to.

  :::
  
  :::info
  Tolgee uses [Redisson](https://github.com/redisson/redisson) to interface with the Redis server. You can find the properties Redisson expects [here](https://github.com/redisson/redisson/tree/56ea7f5/redisson-spring-boot-starter#2-add-settings-into-applicationsettings-file).

Users get automatically logged in as the administrator account of the Tolgee instance. This is very useful, when you want to use Tolgee on your local machine, or you just want to test it.  (default: `true` when running with Java directly, `false` when running via Docker.)

- <h5 id="initial-password"><code>INITIAL_PASSWORD</code></h5>

  By default, when the user has no organization, one is created for them; this doesn't apply when this setting is set to `false`. In that case, the user without organization has no permissions on the server.

There is a significant difference between global and per organization SSO: Global SSO can handle authentication for all server users no matter which organizations they belong to, while per organization SSO can handle authentication only for users of the organization and such users cannot be members of any other organization. SSO users associated with per organization SSO have no rights to create or manage organizations. Global SSO users should be invited to organizations they need to have access to.

- <h5 id="token-uri"><code>TOKEN_URI</code></h5>

  URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens

<h4 id="per-organization-single-sign-on">Per-Organization Single Sign-On</h4>

Prefix: `TOLGEE_AUTHENTICATION_SSO_ORGANIZATIONS`

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. To use SSO in Tolgee, can either configure global SSO settings in `sso-global` section or in the per Organization mode by setting the `enable` to `true` in this section and configuring it separately for each organization in the organization settings.

There is a significant difference between global and per organization SSO: Global SSO can handle authentication for all server users no matter which organizations they belong to, while per organization SSO can handle authentication only for users of the organization and such users cannot be members of any other organization. SSO users associated with per organization SSO have no rights to create or manage organizations. Global SSO users should be invited to organizations they need to have access to. Per organization SSO users are automatically added to the organization they belong to.

  How many parallel jobs can be run at once on single Tolgee instance (default: `1`)

<h3 id="cache">Cache</h3>

Prefix: `TOLGEE_CACHE`

At the expense of higher memory footprint, Tolgee can use a cache to reduce the stress on the database and fetch the
data it needs faster. Cache is also used to track certain states, such as rate limits.

- <h5 id="caffeine-max-size"><code>CAFFEINE_MAX_SIZE</code></h5>

  Maximum size of the Caffeine cache. When exceeded, some entries will be purged from cache. Set to -1 to disable size limitation.
  This has no effect when Redis cache is used. See

  :::info
  In a distributed environment, you **should** use a Redis server to ensure consistent enforcement of rate limits, as
  they heavily rely on cache. For a simple single-node deployment, in-memory cache is sufficient.
  :::
  
  :::info
  Tolgee uses [Redisson](https://github.com/redisson/redisson) to interface with the Redis server. You can find the properties Redisson expects [here](https://github.com/redisson/redisson/tree/56ea7f5/redisson-spring-boot-starter#2-add-settings-into-applicationsettings-file).
