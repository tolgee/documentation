After you have [created a project](creating_project), you can import existing files into the project, use our JS SDK or Android SDK to seamlessly integrate your code with your Tolgee project, or use our translation API to integrate your project with your own system.

## How to Import Translation Files into Tolgee

To import existing translation files into your project (like JSON translation files), open the created project and click on the `Import` menu item.
Then select what language and [namespace](/platform/translation_keys/namespaces) (not required) you want to import the files into and click the `Import` button. This way you can bulk import translations and save time on manually adding translations.

More information about importing files and translation file format can be found in the [Import](/platform/projects_and_organizations/import) page.

## How to Export Translation Files into Tolgee

To export the translations, open the project and click on the `Export` menu item.
Then select what languages, file formats and [namespaces](/platform/translation_keys/namespaces) you want to export and click the `Export` button.

More information about exporting files can be found in the [Export](/platform/projects_and_organizations/export) page.

## JavaScript SDK Integration for Localization

Tolgee provides a [JS SDK](/js-sdk) that can be used to easily integrate your Tolgee project with your codebase.
This way, you can use the same translation keys in your code as you use in your Tolgee project.

In production mode, you should use data exported from the Tolgee platform.
To export the translation files, see [exporting translations](/platform/projects_and_organizations/export).
Then provide the data via Tolgee configuration options described in [Providing static data](/js-sdk/providing-static-data).

## iOS SDK for Localization

Tolgee provides a native [iOS SDK](/ios-sdk) with a great support for SwiftUI that integrates with your app and supports OTA updates of strings from a CDN.

## Android SDK for Localization

Tolgee also provides an [Android SDK](/android-sdk) for native Android apps, including Jetpack Compose support. Follow the Android docs to:

- Install and initialize the SDK: [Installation](/android-sdk/installation)
- Use translations in Views and handle plurals/parameters: [Usage](/android-sdk/usage)
- Use localized composables: [Jetpack Compose](/android-sdk/jetpack/installation)

In production, configure content delivery (CDN) using the Android [Installation](/android-sdk/installation) and [Production guide](/android-sdk/production), and preload data as needed.
