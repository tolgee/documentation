After you have [created a project](creating_project), you can import existing content into the project, use our JS SDK to seamlessly integrate your code with your Tolgee project, or use our API to integrate your project with your own system.

## Importing content

To import existing translation files into your project, open the created project and click on the `Import` menu item.
Then select what language and [namespace](/platform/translation_keys/namespaces) (not required) you want to import the content into and click the `Import` button.

More information about importing content can be found in the [Import](/platform/projects_and_organizations/import) page.

## Exporting content

To export the translations, open the project and click on the `Export` menu item.
Then select what languages, file formats and [namespaces](/platform/translation_keys/namespaces) you want to export and click the `Export` button.

More information about exporting content can be found in the [Export](/platform/projects_and_organizations/export) page.

## JS SDK

Tolgee provides a [JS SDK](/js-sdk) that can be used to easily integrate your Tolgee project with your codebase.
This way, you can use the same translation keys in your code as you use in your Tolgee project.

In production mode, you should use data exported from the Tolgee platform.
To export the translation files, see [exporting translations](/platform/projects_and_organizations/export).
Then provide the data via Tolgee configuration options described in [Providing static data](/js-sdk/providing-static-data).
