Tolgee is a **localization platform** that allows you to translate your application into any language without modifying your code.
It is designed to be used with web applications, but it can be used also with mobile apps and desktop applications.

Tolgee is a developer-focused platform, so it is **easy to integrate** with your application.
No more looking for keys in your source code, no more editing localization files, and no more manual exporting data for translators.

## Features
