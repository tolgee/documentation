After logging in or clicking on Tolgee logo in left top corner, you will be redirected to the Projects list view.

To create a project, click the `+ Add` button in the upper right corner. Then fill the name of the project and select the languages (you can also create a custom language).

You need to select one of the languages as a **base language** â€“ this language will be used as a source of translations. You can add more languages later in the [Languages settings](/platform/projects_and_organizations/languages#languages-settings).
