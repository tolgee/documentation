This guide will help you set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your server using OpenID Connect.

## Global SSO vs Organizations SSO

Two separate operation modes are available to set up for SSO for self-hosted instances of Tolgee. By default, both are disabled.

### Global SSO

Global SSO allows you to set up a single SSO configuration for the whole server. This authentication method is comparable to any
other third-party authentication method for users. Follow the steps in the
[Global Single Sign-On (SSO) Server Configuration](/platform/sso/sso_server_setup_global) guide to set up Global SSO.

### Organizations SSO

Organizations SSO allows you to set up separate SSO configurations for each organization. When the user signs up using this method, their account
will be managed by the organization they signed up with, and they won't be able to leave that organization or join another organization.
To set up an Organizations SSO, follow the steps in the
[Organizations Single Sign-On (SSO) Server Configuration](/platform/sso/sso_server_setup_organizations) guide.
