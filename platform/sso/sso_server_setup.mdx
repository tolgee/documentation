This guide will help you set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your server using OpenID Connect.

## Global SSO vs Organizations SSO

There are two separate modes of operation available to set up for SSO for self-hosted instances of Tolgee. By default, both are disabled.

### Global SSO

Global SSO allows you to set up a single SSO configuration for whole server. For users this authentication method is comparable to any
other third-party authentication method. To set up Global SSO, follow the steps in the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_server_setup_global) guide.

### Organizations SSO

Organizations SSO allows you to set up separate SSO configuration for each organization. When user signs up using this method, their account
will be managed by the organization they signed up to and they won't be able to leave that organization or join another organizations.
To set up Organizations SSO, follow the steps in the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_server_setup_organizations) guide.
