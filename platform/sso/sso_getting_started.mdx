## Configure OIDC application with your Identity Provider (IdP)

Now you need to register OIDC application with your Identity Provider (IdP) and provide Client ID and Client Secret and
Well-Known configuration URL's to Tolgee. Configuration OIDC application is different for each IdP, but commonly you need
to set Sign-in redirect URI (if you use Tolgee cloud URL is https://app.tolgee.io/login/open-id/auth-callback) and Grant type to Authorization Code.
You can find a guide for popular IdPs in the [section below](#guides-for-popular-identity-providers).

## Configure Tolgee

After you have registered and configured OIDC application, you need to provide the following information to Tolgee:

<SsoFieldsTable
  data={[
    {
      item: 'Domain name',
      description: 'Used to identify the organization on login page',
    },
    {
      item: 'Client ID',
      description: 'Unique identifier for an application',
    },
    {
      item: 'Client Secret',
      description: 'Key used to authenticate the application',
    },
    {
      item: 'Authorization URL',
      description: 'URL to redirect users for authentication',
    },
    {
      item: 'Token URL',
      description: 'URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens',
    },
    {
      item: 'JWKS URI',
      description: 'URL to retrieve the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)',
    },
    {
      item: 'Tolgee URL',
      description: 'URL of your Tolgee instance',
    },
  ]}
/>


After you have provided this information, click the ** Save ** button. You can now log in to your Tolgee account using SSO.
For this purpose, you can use the ** Login with SSO ** button on the login page and provide your organization domain name.
