## Configure the OIDC application with your Identity Provider (IdP)

Now you must register the OIDC application with your Identity Provider (IdP) and provide Client ID, Client Secret and
well-known configuration URLs to Tolgee. Configuration OIDC application is different for each IdP, but commonly you need
to set the Sign-in redirect URI (if you use Tolgee cloud URL is https://app.tolgee.io/login/auth_callback/sso) and Grant type to Authorization Code and Refresh Token.
You can find a guide for popular IdPs in the [section below](#guides-for-popular-identity-providers).

## Configure Tolgee

After you have registered and configured the OIDC application, you need to provide the following information to Tolgee:

<SsoFieldsTable
    data={[
        {
            item: 'Domain name',
            description: 'Used to identify the organization on login page',
        },
        {
            item: 'Client ID',
            description: 'Unique identifier for an application',
        },
        {
            item: 'Client Secret',
            description: 'Key used to authenticate the application',
        },
        {
            item: 'Authorization URL',
            description: 'URL to redirect users for authentication',
        },
        {
            item: 'Token URL',
            description: 'URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens',
        },
    ]}
/>


After you have provided this information, click the **Save** button. You can now log in to your Tolgee account using SSO.
For this purpose, you can use the **Login with SSO** button on the login page and provide your organization's domain name.
