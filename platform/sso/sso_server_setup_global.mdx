    sso-global:
      enabled: true
      domain: example.com # Domain name used to identify the organization on the login page
      client-id: # Unique identifier for an application
      client-secret: # Key used to authenticate the application
      authorization-uri: # URL to redirect users for authentication

Restart your Tolgee server to apply the changes and try logging in with an SSO account.
