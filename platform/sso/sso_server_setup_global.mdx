    sso-global:
      enabled: true
      domain: example.com # Domain name used to identify the organization on the login page
      client-id: # Unique identifier for an application
      client-secret: # Key used to authenticate the application
      authorization-uri: # URL to redirect users for authentication
      token-uri: # URL for exchanging authorization code for tokens
      custom-logo-url: # Optional URL to a custom logo to display on the login page

```

Restart your Tolgee server to apply the changes, and try logging in with an SSO account.
