[//]: # (TODO)

## Set Up Tolgee

When you have all the necessary information from Keycloak, you need to enable the SSO feature in your organization settings and provide the necessary information to Tolgee.
You can find how to enable SSO in the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_getting_started) guide.

## Log In with SSO

Once you have set up SSO, you can log in to Tolgee using the **Log in with SSO** button on the login page and enter the domain name.
After that, you will be redirected to the Keycloak login page to authenticate.
