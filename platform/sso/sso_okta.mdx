:::info Feature availability
Single Sign-On is available for enterprise plans. [Upgrade your plan](https://tolgee.io/pricing) to use this feature.

If you use the self-hosted version, you must [set up the license](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) and then follow the [sso server setup guide](/platform/sso/sso_server_setup) to use this feature.
:::

This guide will help you set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization using OpenID Connect with Okta. See the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_getting_started) guide for more generalized steps on setting up SSO.

## Set Up Okta

First, you must set up an **OpenID Connect application** in Okta. To do this, log in to your Okta account
and navigate to the **Admin** panel. Then find the **Applications** section and click on **Create App Integration**:

Now select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the Sign-in method and **Web Application**  click **Next**:

Fill in the **Application settings**:
- Grant type: **Authorization Code**
- Login redirect URIs: **https://app.tolgee.io/login/auth_callback/sso** (if you use Tolgee cloud) or your Tolgee instance URL ending with `/login/auth_callback/sso`

Click **Save**. Here is how the settings can look like:

Now you need to provide Client ID and Client Secret to Tolgee. You can find these in your Okta application's **General Settings**.
Also, provide **Authorization URL** and **Token URL**.
There is a **Well-Known configuration URL** in your Okta application's **Security - API** tab. You can use this URL to get all the necessary endpoints.

You can create a new **Authorization Server** or use the existing one here.
Create an **Access Policy** for the **Authorization Server** and set the refresh token lifetime to unlimited.

:::warning
If the lifetime of the refresh token isn't set to unlimited, the user will be logged out after the token expires, and
all user tokens will stop working until the user logs in again. This will break your pipelines and other automated processes.

To find the **Well-Known configuration URL**, click on the chosen **Authorization Server** and navigate to **Metadata URI**.

## Set Up Tolgee

When you have all the necessary information from Okta, you need to enable the SSO feature in your organization settings and provide the necessary information to Tolgee.
You can find how to enable SSO in the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_getting_started) guide.

## Log In with SSO

Once you have set up SSO, you can log in to Tolgee using the **Log in with SSO** button on the login page and enter the domain name.
After that, you will be redirected to the Okta login page to authenticate.
