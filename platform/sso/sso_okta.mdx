This guide will help you set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization using OpenID Connect with Okta.

## Set Up Okta

First, you need to set up an **OpenID Connect application** in Okta. To do this, you need to log in to your Okta account
and navigate to **Admin** panel. Then find the **Applications** section and click on **Create App Integration**:

Now select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the Sign-in method and **Web Application**  click **Next**:

Fill in the **Application settings**:
- Grant type: **Authorization Code**
- Login redirect URIs: **https://app.tolgee.io/login/open-id/auth-callback** (if you use Tolgee cloud) or your Tolgee instance URL ending with `/login/open-id/auth-callback`
e.g. `https://tolgee-frontend-<name>/login/open-id/auth-callback`

Click **Save**. Here is how the settings can look like:

Now you need to provide Client ID and Client Secret to Tolgee. You can find these in the **General Settings** of your Okta application.
Also provide **Authorization URL**, **Token URL**, and **JWKS URL**.
There is a **Well-Known configuration URL** in the **Security - API** tab of your Okta application. You can use this URL to get all necessary endpoints.

Here you can create new **Authorization Server** or use the existing one. To find the **Well-Known configuration URL**,
click on chosen **Authorization Server** and navigate to **Metadata URI**.


## Set Up Tolgee

When you have all the necessary information from Okta, you need to enable the SSO feature in your organization settings
and provide the necessary information to Tolgee.
You can find how to enable SSO in the [SSO Getting Started](/platform/sso/sso_getting_started) guide.

## Log In with SSO

Once you have set up SSO, you can log in to Tolgee using the **Log in with SSO** button on the login page and entering domain name.
After that, you will be redirected to the Okta login page to authenticate.
