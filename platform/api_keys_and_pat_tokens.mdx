API keys and PAT tokens are authentication methods enabling you to manage your data via REST API.

## Project API keys
:::info
The API key format was changed in version **2.38.0**. Now all API keys have the `tgpak_` prefix. However, if you provide
legacy API key to the header or to query param, it will be accepted.
:::


Project API keys are useful to manipulate project resources like keys, translations, or screenshots. You can use them as
an authentication method for Tolgee integration libraries.

The Project API key
 - Authorizes access to single project resources
 - Allows specifying permitted scopes

You can manage all your API keys via the `Project API keys` section in the user account menu.
To access your API keys, open user menu (Avatar in Top right) and select `Project API keys`.

In this section you are able to generate, edit, delete or regenerate your keys.

### Generation

Project API keys can be generated by accessing user menu (Avatar in Top right) > `Project API keys` > `+ ADD` button.

Then you can generate a project API by filling in required fields and selecting scopes.

### Regeneration
If you want to obtain a new Project API key value, you can regenerate it by clicking the `REGENERATE` button. Then you can select new
expiration date.

### Usage

To access REST API endpoints with a Project API key, you can provide the API key via the `X-API-Key` header or via the `ak` query param.
We don't recommend using the `ak` query param anymore, since it can be stored in server logs.

Example using header (recommended):
```
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/api-keys/current" -H "X-API-Key: tgpak_mmztgz2hmaxts2rynu3w6zlkobsksksnfvg6mlrgq2gc2dq"
```

Example using query param (not-recommended):
```
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/api-keys/current?ak=tgpak_mmztgz2hmaxts2rynu3w6zlkobsksksnfvg6mlrgq2gc2dq"
```

## Personal Access Tokens (PAT tokens)
PAT tokens authorize a user to work with all resources the user has access to, except resources managing the PAT tokens and
other sensitive endpoints.

:::info
The Personal Access Tokens were released in version **2.38.0**.
:::


You can manage all your Tokens via `Personal Access Tokens` in the user account menu.
To access your API keys, open user menu (Avatar in Top right) and select `Personal Access Tokens`.

### Generation
Project API keys can be generated by accessing user menu (Avatar in Top right) > `Personal Access Tokens` > `+ ADD` button.

### Regeneration
If you want to obtain a new Token value, you can regenerate it by clicking `REGENERATE` in the `Personal Access Tokens` section.
Then you can select a new expiration date.

### Usage

To access REST API endpoints with an PAT, you can provide it via header.

Example using header:
```
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/user" -H "X-API-Key: tgpat_c813fppevpm6smlv8gld2fqq7knqqfht5ri1vgo57gj6ivkbhp5"
