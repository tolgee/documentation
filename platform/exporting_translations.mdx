To export translations, go to the app, select project, and then choose the "Export" item from the sidebar.
Afterward, hit the "EXPORT ZIP OF . JSON FILES" button. The download will start immediately.

## Exporting via command line

You can also export translations via REST API, e.g., via the `curl` utility:

```bash
curl https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export -H "X-API-Key: <Your API key>" --output data.zip
```

To configure the result options, check the [API documentation](/api#tag/Export/operation/export_1).

### Examples

#### Disabling nesting in exported files
When exporting to .json, the data is structured to nested objects by default. So the output looks like this.
```json
{
 "homepage":
  {
    "title": "Welcome!"
  }
}
```

To change this behavior, provide the `structureDelimiter` query parameter.
```bash
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export?structureDelimiter=" -H "X-API-Key: <Your API key>" --output data.zip
```

When `structureDelimiter` is empty, nesting is disabled.

#### Exporting only specific namespaces
By default, all namespaces are exported. To export only some of them, provide `filterNamespace` parameter.
```bash
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export?filterNamespace=ns-1&filterNamespace=ns-2" -H "X-API-Key: <Your API key>" --output data.zip
```

#### Including untranslated strings
By default, only non-empty values are exported. To export also `null` values, set `filterState` parameter.
```bash
curl "https://app.tolgee.io/v2/projects/export?filterState=UNTRANSLATED&filterState=TRANSLATED&filterState=REVIEWED" \
-H "X-API-Key: <Your API key>" --output data.zip
```
