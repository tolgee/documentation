Merging applies the changes from one branch (the **source**) into another branch (the **target**). Before the merge is applied, Tolgee analyses the differences and shows you a preview so you can review everything — and resolve any conflicts — before committing.

## Initiating a Merge

Go to **Branching** in the project sidebar. Click the **branch icon button** next to the branch you want to merge. Tolgee immediately opens the merge preview page.

:::info
The merge always goes into the **default branch** (`main`). To merge into a different target, contact your administrator or restructure your branching workflow.
:::

## Understanding the Merge Preview

The merge preview shows a summary of all differences between the source and target branch, grouped into four categories:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/branching/screenshot_07_merge_preview_overview.png"
  alt="Merge preview showing change summary and conflict panel"
/>

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Added** | Keys that exist in the source branch but not in the target — they will be created |
| **Modified** | Keys that were changed in the source branch — the target version will be updated |
| **Deleted** | Keys that were removed in the source branch — they will be deleted from the target |
| **Conflicts** | Keys that were changed in *both* branches — you must choose which version to keep |

The tabs below the summary let you browse each category. Non-conflicting changes (Added, Modified, Deleted) are applied automatically.

### Reviewing Modified Changes

The **Modified** tab shows a three-column view: source branch on the left, merge preview in the centre, and the target branch on the right.

<ScreenshotWrapper

  alt="Modified tab showing three-column comparison view"
/>

These changes require no action — they will be applied automatically when you complete the merge.

## Resolving Conflicts

A conflict occurs when the same key was changed in both branches since the branch was created. You must choose which version to keep before the merge can be completed.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/branching/screenshot_09_merge_conflict_panel.png"
  alt="Conflict panel showing source and target versions side by side"
/>

For each conflict, you see:
- The **source branch** version on the left
- The **merge preview** (empty until resolved) in the centre
- The **target branch** version on the right

Click **Accept** on either side to choose that version. The merge preview in the centre updates to reflect your choice and the conflict is marked as resolved.

You can expand **All Translations** to see all languages for a key before deciding.

:::info
Tags, labels, and screenshots are always **combined** from both branches — they are never lost in a merge.
:::

## Completing the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved, the **Complete the merge** button becomes active and the conflicts counter shows all resolved.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/branching/screenshot_10_merge_ready_to_complete.png"
  alt="Merge ready to complete with all conflicts resolved"
/>

Optionally check **Delete [branch name] after merge** to automatically remove the source branch once the merge is applied.

Click **Complete the merge** to apply all changes to the target branch.

## Merge Invalidation

If the source or target branch is modified while the merge preview is open (for example, someone edits a translation in the meantime), the merge preview becomes stale. Tolgee will notify you and offer a **Refresh** option to re-analyse the differences with the latest state of both branches.

Any conflict resolutions you already made are preserved where possible after a refresh.
