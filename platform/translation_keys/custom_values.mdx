The translation keys may contain custom values, which can be edited from the `Edit Key` dialog, and custom values, which
are added by Tolgee when importing data.

The custom values are also available when accessing the data via REST API via the `custom` field on the translation key.

## Editing custom values
To edit custom values
1. Go to translations view
2. Click the key name to open the `Edit Key` dialog
3. Switch to `Custom Values` tab

import { ScreenshotWrapper } from "../shared/_ScreenshotWrapper";

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/translation_keys/custom_values.webp"
                   alt="ICU Placeholders disabled" />



## Tolgee internal Custom Values
The custom values prefixed by the `_` character are used by Tolgee and have special meaning.
For example, `_flutterArbPlaceholders` is used to store placeholder metadata for Flutter, and it's used when exporting data to flutter arb format.
