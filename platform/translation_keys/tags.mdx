Tags help group translation keys for easier work and batch operations on multiple keys within a specific group. Tolgee allows you to create tags, assign them to keys, and filter by them in the Translation view.

With tags, you cannot selectively export a particular set of keys like you can with [namespaces](namespaces).

## Create and Assign Tags

To assign a tag to a key, click the `+ tag` icon on the key in Translations view:

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/tag.webp" alt="Add tag to key" />

Then you can **assign an existing tag or create a new one** by typing the name and pressing `Enter`.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/add-tag.webp"
  alt="add new tag to key"
/>

## Filter by Tags

There are two ways how to filter keys by tags.

### Using Filter Dropdown

1. Click the `Filter...` dropdown in the Translations view
2. Click `Tags`
3. Select one or multiple tags

### Click on a Tag to Filter

1. Click the tag in a key
2. The tag will be automatically added to the filtering and the keys will be filtered by it
