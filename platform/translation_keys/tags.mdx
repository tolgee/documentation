Tolgee allows you to manage tags in the application â€“ you can create, assign them to keys and filter for them in the Translation view.

With tags, you cannot selectively export a particular set of keys like you can with [namespaces](namespaces).

## Creating and assigning tags

To assign a tag to a key, click the `+ tag` icon on the key in Translations view:

Then you can **assign an existing tag or create a new one** by typing the name and pressing `Enter`.
