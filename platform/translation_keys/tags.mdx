Tolgee allows you to manage tags in the application â€“ you can create, assign them to keys and filter for them in the Translation view.

With tags, you cannot selectively export a particular set of keys like you can with [namespaces](namespaces).

## Creating and assigning tags

To assign a tag to a key, click the `+ tag` icon on the key in Translations view:

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/tag.webp" alt="Add tag to key" />

Then you can **assign an existing tag or create a new one** by typing the name and pressing `Enter`.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/add-tag.webp"
  alt="add new tag to key"
/>

## Filtering by tags

There are two ways how to filter keys by tags.

### Using filter dropdown

1. Click the `Filter...` dropdown in the Translations view
2. Click `Tags`
3. Select one or multiple tags

### Clicking on tag

1. Click the tag in a key
2. The tag will be automatically added to the filtering and the keys will be filtered by it
