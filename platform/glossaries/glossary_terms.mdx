# Translate Glossary Terms

1. Add the desired language to the list of languages in the top right corner next to the `+ Term` button
2. Click on the translation cell for the desired language
3. Enter the translation for the term
4. Click Save

This will not work if the base language term has a "Non-translatable" tag as it will stay the same in all languages.
