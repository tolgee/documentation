# Import and Export Terms to a Glossary

Importing and exporting glossary terms helps you manage terminology at scale and keep your projects consistent. 
This page explains how to upload terms from a CSV file or download an existing glossary for external use. Basic glossary term actions, such as editing and deleting terms, are documented on the [Glossary Terms Actions](/platform/glossaries/glossary_terms) page.

## Import Terms to a Glossary

If you already have a CSV file containing terms you want to add to your glossary, you can import them by following these steps:

1. After creating a new glossary, click the `Import glossary` button
2. Select a CSV file in the recommended format
3. Choose an option for how you want to import your terms to the glossary:
   - Replace glossary
   - Add to glossary 
4. Click `Import`

## Import Terms to an Empty Glossary

To import terms from a CSV file into an empty glossary, create a new glossary and open it. Then click “Import a glossary” in the right column or select the second icon to the left of the “+ Term” button. 

Afterward, upload or drag and drop a CSV file, then click “Import.”

## Import Terms to an Existing Glossary

To import terms into an existing glossary, first open the glossary you would like to import terms into. Then click the second icon to the left of the “+ Term” button.

Afterwards, follow the steps to [Add to Glossary](/platform/glossaries/importing_and_exporting_glossaries#import-with-an-option-add-to-glossary) or to [Replace a Glossary](/platform/glossaries/importing_and_exporting_glossaries#import-with-an-option-to-replace-a-glossary).

## Options While Importing to an Existing Glossary 

When importing to an existing glossary you have two options on how to add the terms. Here are the differences:

### Import With an Option to Replace a Glossary

After selecting a file to import, choose "Replace glossary" import mode if you want to delete all existing terms and import new ones from the CSV file. It is useful if you have a CSV file as your source of truth.

/>

### Import with an Option Add to Glossary

After selecting a file to import, choose the “Add to Glossary” import mode if you want to add new terms from your CSV file to the glossary. This option is useful when you have new terms to add in bulk. Do not use it with CSV files containing terms that already exist in the glossary, as this may create duplicates. Because a glossary can contain identical terms with different meanings, existing terms are not replaced.

## Format of the CSV File

Ensure that the CSV file meets the recommended format. Copy the structure of the columns:

- **term** - the term itself in the base language
- **description** - description of the term's meaning. This will help translators or AI understand the term better
- **translatable** - indicates whether the term is untranslatable (term is the same in all languages) or translatable (translation is different)
- **casesensitive** - indicates the case matters
- **abbreviation** - indicates the term is an abbreviation
- **forbidden** - indicates the term is forbidden
- **language columns** - use the language tag (short form) for languages used in the projects

## Export Terms from a Glossary

To export all terms, open the glossary and click the first icon to the left of the “+ Term” button.

1. If you need to download the glossary as a CSV file, click the `Export glossary` icon
2. The glossary will be automatically downloaded
