# Manage Glossaries - Translation Terminology

Glossaries help you maintain consistent terminology across your translations.
You can create glossaries at the organization level and assign them to projects.

Glossaries can be called differently in other Translation Management Systems (TMS) or localization workflows. 
To clarify, we use the term "Glossary" as it best describes the features we provide. The base functionality of a Glossary on Tolgee is a list of key terms and their preferred translations with some additional tags for special cases like abbreviations and foribdden terms.

Other names for similar features include: termbase (or Term Base / TB), which can also contain data like usage and status, and terminology database / terminology management system / terminology repository / terminology list, which is a more generic term that often includes not only translations but also guidelines for how certain words should be used within an organization.

# Managing Glossaries (termbase)

This section describes how to work with glossaries and the terms in them. Translation glossary helps with terminology management by keeping it consistent and standardized. This provides brand consistency by keeping track of non-translatable terms, case-sensitive terms, abbreviations and so on. 

## How to Access Organization Glossaries

Here, you can see a list of glossaries in your organization.

1. Go to Organization settings
2. Select Glossaries in the side menu

It is important to note that a user can see all glossaries if they have access to any project within the organization.

The user can add a glossary and edit it if the access is set to at least a maintainer. You can edit the user's project access in the [Organization members](/platform/projects_and_organizations/organization_settings#how-to-manage-organization-members-and-roles) tab.

## How to Create a New Glossary

1. Click the `+ Glossary` button to open the dialog window to create the glossary
2. Enter a name for the glossary
3. Assign the glossary to projects (it is optional but essential for working with glossaries properly)
4. Select a base language
5. Click `Create`
6. Next, you can add the terms with "+ Term" button

The base language and the glossary languages are derived from the projects that were assigned to the glossary. The languages can be added to the project themselves, and then they will be automatically assigned.

# How to Import or Export Glossary Terms

You can import glossary terms from a CSV file to quickly build or update your terminology database. 
You can also export any glossary as a CSV file for external editing, sharing, or backup. Learn how to do that in the [Import and Export Terms to a Glossary](/platform/glossaries/importing_and_exporting_glossaries) section.
