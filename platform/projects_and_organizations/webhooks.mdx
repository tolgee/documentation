:::info Feature availability
Webhooks are introduced in the business and enterprise plans. [Upgrade your plan](https://tolgee.io/pricing) to use this feature.

If you use the self-hosted version, you need to [set up the license](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) to use this feature.

Webhooks are very useful when you want to react to events that happen in your Tolgee project.
Every modifying activity triggers a webhook. The most common scenario is reacting to translation keys being added
or translations being updated.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/webhooks/webhooks.png" alt="Webhooks" />

## Creating a webhook

You can set up the Webhooks in the `Developer settings` section of the Tolgee platform under the `Webhooks` tab.

To create a webhook, click the `+ Webhook` button.

The only thing you need to provide is the target URL of your webhook.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/webhooks/create_form.png" alt="Create webbhook form" />

When a webhook is created, you can also test it by clicking the `Test` button in the list.

## Using the secret

Every webhook has a generated secret. This secret can be used to verify that the webhook was sent by Tolgee.
The webhook requests contain a header, `Tolgee-Signature`. The value of this header is JSON containing the
timestamp and the signature.

You can get the secret by hitting the `Show secret` button in the list.

The signature is an HMAC SHA256 hash of the timestamp and the request body using the secret as a key. You should also
verify that the timestamp is not too old (5 minutes - 300 000 ms) should be fine.

You can check this javascript (node.js) code to see how to verify the signature:

```javascript
function verifyWebhookSignatureHeader(req, secret) {
  const header = JSON.parse(req.headers["tolgee-signature"])
  const timestamp = header["timestamp"]
  const signature = header["signature"]

  if (header["timestamp"] <= 0) {
    return false
  }

  const signedPayload = `${timestamp}.${req.body}`; // req.body has to be string!!
  const expectedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(signedPayload).digest('hex');
  if (expectedSignature !== signature) {
    return false;
  }

  if (timestamp < Date.now() - 300000) {
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

## Using the webhook data
The webhook endpoint contains the data about the event in the request body.

```
{
   "webhookConfigId":1000044001,
   "eventType":"PROJECT_ACTIVITY",
   "activityData":{
      ...
   }
}
```

- webhookConfigId: This is a unique identifier for the webhook configuration.
- eventType: This indicates the type of event that triggers the webhook. `PROJECT_ACTIVITY` or `TEST`.
- activityData: This is an object containing data related to the activity.

To provide the activity data, we use the same structure as in the
[project activity endpoint](/api#tag/Projects/operation/getActivity_1).

### activityData
This item contains data about the activity that triggered the webhook.

It contains this fields:

- revisionId: A unique identifier for the revision.
- timestamp: The time when the activity happened.
- type: The type of activity. `UNKNOWN`, `SET_TRANSLATION_STATE`, `SET_TRANSLATIONS`,
`DISMISS_AUTO_TRANSLATED_STATE`, `SET_OUTDATED_FLAG`, `TRANSLATION_COMMENT_ADD`, `TRANSLATION_COMMENT_DELETE`, `TRANSLATION_COMMENT_EDIT`, `TRANSLATION_COMMENT_SET_STATE`, `SCREENSHOT_DELETE`, `SCREENSHOT_ADD`, `KEY_TAGS_EDIT`, `KEY_NAME_EDIT`, `KEY_DELETE`, `CREATE_KEY`, `COMPLEX_EDIT`, `IMPORT`, `CREATE_LANGUAGE`, `EDIT_LANGUAGE`, `DELETE_LANGUAGE`, `CREATE_PROJECT`, `EDIT_PROJECT`, `NAMESPACE_EDIT`, `BATCH_PRE_TRANSLATE_BY_TM`, `BATCH_MACHINE_TRANSLATE`, `AUTO_TRANSLATE`, `BATCH_CLEAR_TRANSLATIONS`, `BATCH_COPY_TRANSLATIONS`, `BATCH_SET_TRANSLATION_STATE`, `BATCH_TAG_KEYS`, `BATCH_UNTAG_KEYS`, `BATCH_SET_KEYS_NAMESPACE`
- author: An object containing information about the author.
- modifiedEntities: An object containing information about the entities that were modified.

The most important field would probably be the `modifiedEntities`. There is the information about what exactly changed.

It contains a map of entity types to list of modifications. For example if someone changes a translation in your project,
it leads to a `SET_TRANSLATIONS` activity. The `modifiedEntities` would contain this:

```
"Translation":[
  {
     "entityId":1000049001,
     "description":{

     },
     "modifications":{
        "text":{
           "old":"Hello!",
           "new":"Hi!"
        }
     },
     "relations":{
        "key":{
           "entityClass":"Key",
           "entityId":1000048001,
           "data":{
              "name":"asda"
           },
           "relations":{

           },
           "exists":true
        },
        "language":{
           "entityClass":"Language",
           "entityId":1000041001,
           "data":{
              "tag":"en",
              "name":"English",
              "flagEmoji":"ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
           },
           "relations":{

           },
           "exists":true
        }
     },
     "exists":null
  }
]
```

These operations don't provide all the information about modifications since the amount of changes might be extremely large. You will have to handle such events differently.

`KEY_DELETE`, `IMPORT`, `DELETE_LANGUAGE`, `BATCH_PRE_TRANSLATE_BY_TM`, `BATCH_MACHINE_TRANSLATE`, `AUTO_TRANSLATE`, `BATCH_CLEAR_TRANSLATIONS
BATCH_COPY_TRANSLATIONS`, `BATCH_SET_TRANSLATION_STATE`, `BATCH_TAG_KEYS`, `BATCH_UNTAG_KEYS`, `BATCH_SET_KEYS_NAMESPACE`, `AUTOMATION`

## Failing webhooks
When the execution fails, the webhook is retried several times. Because of this, it is a good idea to check the timestamp
of the webhooks so you don't use outdated data.

If the webhook fails, you can see a `failing` marker in the list.
