Tolgee supports importing existing translations from various formats. You can import translations from JSON, XLIFF, and PO files.

import { ScreenshotWrapper } from "../shared/_ScreenshotWrapper";

## Importing to Tolgee

To import translations to Tolgee, you need to have a project created. You can create a project in the [Projects](/platform/getting_started/creating_project) section.
After creating a project, you can import translations to it by navigating to the "Import" page.

Then you can select the file you want to import or drag and drop it to the import page. You can import multiple files at once.

After selecting the file(s) to import, you can **select the language** of the strings and the namespace.
You can also check which keys and strings will be imported by clicking on the number under `Translation count` column.

When you are done, click the `Import` button and the file will be imported into Tolgee.

### Resolving conflicts

When you import a file, Tolgee will check if the imported strings already exist in the project. If there are some **conflicts** in the strings, you will be prompted to **resolve them**.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/import/import_conflicts.webp" alt="Import conflicts" />

You can choose to accept the old (existing) strings or accept the imported strings.
You can make this change for all the conflicts at once by clicking on the `Accept old` or `Accept imported` button respectively, or you can make the change for each conflict individually.

After resolving the conflicts, you can close this dialog by clicking on the `Close` button and you will be redirected back to the import page.

## Importing placeholders
When importing translations, Tolgee will automatically convert the placeholders to the [Tolgee Universal ICU Placeholders](/platform/translation_process/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).
when enabled. You can find out how the placeholders are converted in the docs for the [specific format](../supported_formats).

You can control the conversion of the placeholders in the import settings by setting the `Convert placeholders to Tolgee Universal ICU`.

Read more about the Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders [here](/platform/translation_process/tolgee_universal_icu_placeholders).

## Overriding key descriptions
You can choose to override the key descriptions when importing translations. This option is disabled by default.

## Importing plurals
When importing translations with plural forms, the plural is automatically detected and imported, if the existing key is not a plural yet. The base language value and the language translations are converted to plural as well.
