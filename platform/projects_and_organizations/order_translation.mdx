## Ordering professional translation

Go to the `Tasks` section in the project menu and click the `[Buy] Translation` button:

  alt="Tasks page with order translation button"
/>

You can also order translation directly from batch operations, to select exectly which keys should be included.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-batch-operation.webp"
  alt="Task batch operations"
/>

You will see a list of agencies to pick. Select the agency and follow the `Next` step.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-agencies.webp"
  alt="Order translation agencies list"
/>

Now, you can create a task for the agency, similar to a [regular task](./tasks.mdx). You can filter which languages and keys to include.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-task.webp"
  alt="Order translation task creation"
/>

You can invite the agency to your project immediately (with VIEW permissions).

## What happens next?

Once you `Request quote`, an agency task is created for each language.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-agency-tasks.webp"
  alt="Agency task"
/>

The agency will receive your request with an overview of the tasks (number of keys, words and characters).

They'll also receive your email address and contact you with a price estimate and you'll get an order confirmation on your email.

## Agency access to the project

You should see a pending invitation in the `Members` section if you've invited agency directly into the project. 

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-invitation.webp"
  alt="Agency invitation"
/>

If you want to invite an agency later, you can do the same operation through the `Invite user` button. In the dialog, click on the `Agency tab`.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-invitation-dialog.webp"
  alt="Agency invitation dialog"
/>

Once someone from the agency accepts the invitation, you'll see his account in the `Members` section.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/order-translation/order-translation-member.webp"
  alt="Agency member"
/>

All the agency members are marked, and you can filter them to see who has access to your project.

## Elevating agency permissions

Depending on the requirements, you can change agency account permissions to `Translate`, `Review` or `Manage`. If you want the agency to work more independently, you can grant them `Manage` access. This will allow them to make changes to your project, like inviting more members and creating new tasks.

Tolgee will mark all new users invited by the agency members as agency members as well, and all the tasks will also have an agency label. This way, you can easily distinguish what the agency is doing in your project.
