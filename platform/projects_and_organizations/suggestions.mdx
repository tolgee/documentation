Suggestions allow users to propose changes to strings without editing them directly. The actual string value is changed after a reviewer approves the suggestion.

### How to enable suggestions

Go to `Project settings` > `Advanced` > `Suggestions mode`.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/settings.webp"
  alt="Project settings > Advanced > Suggestions mode"
/>

### Adding a suggestion

Once suggestions mode is enabled, users can edit a translation or add a suggestion.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-menu.webp"
  alt="Adding suggestion via menu"
/>

### Reviewing the suggestion

When a translator adds a suggestion, it is visible in the translations view, but not active (meaning if translations are exported, there is still the old translation).

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-created.webp"
  alt="Created suggestion"
/>

Once a reviewer comes along, they can accept the suggestion.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-accept.webp"
  alt="Accept suggestion"
/>

This is the moment when it will replace the existing translation.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-accepted.webp"
  alt="Suggestion is accepted"
/>

If there are multiple suggestions, you are declining the others by accepting one.

All previously accepted/declined suggestions are found under a "Show all" checkbox.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestions-inactive.webp"
  alt="Inactive suggestions"
/>


### Protecting reviewed translations

Tolgee offers a mode where translators can only edit non-reviewed translations directly. You can enable this in advanced project settings:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/translation-protection-settings.webp"
  alt="Translation protection settings"
/>

So now, when a translator opens a reviewed translation, they can only suggest.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/translation-protection-suggest-only.webp"
  alt="Translation protection - suggest only"
/>

#### Granular protection

If you want more direct control over edit permissions and suggestions, you can do it through
[Granular permissions](/platform/projects_and_organizations/members#granular-permissions).

Here you can, for example, only allow the user to `Suggest`, so they can't edit any translation directly.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestions-granular-permissions.webp"
  alt="Suggestions granular permissions"
/>

> Accepting the suggestions is tied to the "Change state" permission (which is what all reviewers have).
