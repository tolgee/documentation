Suggestions allows users to add translations without editing them directly, translation is then changed only when the suggestion is approved by a reviewer.

### How to enable suggestions

Go to `Project settings` > `Advanced` > `Suggestions mode`.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/settings.png"
  alt="Project settings > Advanced > Suggestions mode"
/>

### Adding a suggestion

Once suggestions mode is enabled, users now have a choice to either edit a translation or add suggestion.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-menu.png"
  alt="Adding suggestion via menu"
/>

### Reviewing the suggestion

When a translator adds a suggestion it is visible in the translations view, but not active (meaning if translations are exported there is still the old translation).

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-created.png"
  alt="Created suggestion"
/>

Once a reviewer comes along, he can accept the suggestion.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-accept.png"
  alt="Accept suggestion"
/>

And this is a moment when it replaces the existing translation.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestion-accepted.png"
  alt="Suggestion is accepted"
/>

If there are multiple suggestions by accepting one you are declining the others.
You can find all previously accepted/declined suggestions by under a "Show all" checkbox.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestions-inactive.png"
  alt="Inactive suggestions"
/>


### Protecting reviewed translations

Tolgee offers a mode where only non-reviewed translations can be edited directly by translators. You can enable this in advanced project settings:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/translation-protection-settings.png"
  alt="Translation protection settings"
/>

So now when a translator opens a reviewed translation, I can only suggest.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/translation-protection-suggest-only.png"
  alt="Translation protection - suggest only"
/>

#### Granular protection

If you want more direct control over edit permissions and suggesting, you can do it through
[Granular permissions](/platform/projects_and_organizations/members#granular-permissions).

Here you can for example only allow user to `Suggest` and he can't edit any translation directly.


<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/suggestions/suggestions-granular-permissions.png"
  alt="Suggestions granular permissions"
/>

> Accepting the suggestions is tied to the "Change state" permission (which is what all reviewers have).
