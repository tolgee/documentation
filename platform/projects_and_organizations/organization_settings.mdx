## Organization members

This page shows the **list of all members in your organization**.

You can invite new members by clicking the **Invite user** button. Then **enter their email address or create an invitation link** to share with them.

You can **set the role of the member**. The role can be one of the following:

- **Member**: The member has basic access to all organization projects.
- **Maintainer**: Same as the member, but also can create new projects and create/edit glossaries.
- **Owner**: The owner of the organization. The owner can manage the organization settings, manage the glossaries, manage the projects, and manage the members.
