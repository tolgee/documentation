## Organization members

This page shows the **list of all members in your organization**.

You can invite new members by clicking the **Invite user** button in the upper right corner. 
Use the toggle on the right-hand side to choose between **entering their email address or creating an invitation link**, to share with them.

Before sending an invite **set the role of a member**. The role can be one of the following:

- **Member**: The member has basic access to all organization projects.
- **Maintainer**: Same as the member, additionally can create new projects and create/edit glossaries.
- **Owner**: The owner of the organization. The owner can manage: the organization settings, the glossaries, the projects and the members.
