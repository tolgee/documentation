## Automatic translation of new keys

Automatic translation is applied when base translation is created and it tries to translate to other languages currently in the project, which are not already filled. It's disabled by default, you can enable it in language settings. Translations that were translated automatically (and not edited by human) are marked by provider icon or translation memory icon.
