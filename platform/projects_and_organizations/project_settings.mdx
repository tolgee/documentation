In project settings, you can edit the basic properties of your project.

- **Project Name**
- **Description** - displayed in the project dashboard (can be formatted with Markdown)
- **Base language** - the language that is used as a base for translating to other languages


Then, there are the options to leave the project, delete it or transfer the ownership to another organization.

## Advanced project settings

### Suggestions mode

When enabled it allows users to add suggestions instead of editing the translation directly. [Read more](./suggestions.mdx)

### Translation protection

This option protects reviewed translations from being switched back to un-reviewed state:
 - Translators cannot edit reviewed translations (they can add suggestions if that is enabled)
 - Reviewers can edit reviewed translations, but they are not reverted back to non-reviewed state (it counts as reviewer also made a review right away)

To see a usecase for this option [read more about suggestions](./suggestions.mdx#protecting-reviewed-translations).

### Tolgee ICU placeholders

By default, Tolgee visualizes ICU placeholders in the translation editor and interprets the strings as ICU messages.
If you want to disable this feature, you can do so in the advanced tab of the project settings.


### Enabling Namespaces

Toggle "Use namespaces" checkbox in "Project settings" to choose your default namespace. After enabling it, a "Default namespace" tab will appear below it where you can choose one.
You can read our article about [namespaces](/platform/translation_keys/namespaces) to learn how to use them.
