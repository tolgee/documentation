In project settings, you can edit the basic properties of your project.

- **Project Name**
- **Description** - displayed in the project dashboard (can be formatted with Markdown)
- **Base language** - the language that is used as a base for translating to other languages
- **Default namespace** - preselected namespace when creating a new key

To use namespaces in your project, you need to have namespaces enabled. Toggle "Use namespaces" to choose your default namespace. 
You can read our article about [namespaces](https://docs.tolgee.io/js-sdk/namespaces) to learn more.

Then, there are the options to leave the project, delete it or transfer the ownership to another organization.

## Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders support

By default, Tolgee visualizes ICU placeholders in the translation editor and interprets the strings as ICU messages.
If you want to disable this feature, you can do so in the advanced tab of the project settings.
