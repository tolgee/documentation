The Project Settings page allows you to configure the project settings for your project.
You can change the **base language** of the project, **project name**, and the **description** of the project (this can be formatted in Markdown).

Then, there are the options to leave the project, delete it or transfer the ownership to another organization.

## Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders support
By default, Tolgee visualizes ICU placeholders in the translation editor and interprets the strings as ICU messages.
If you want to disable this feature, you can do so in the advanced tab of the project settings.
