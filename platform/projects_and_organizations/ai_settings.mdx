## Prompts section

<ScreenshotWrapper
  alt="Providing project description"
  src="/img/docs/platform/ai-settings/prompts-list.webp"
/>

In this section, you can see all custom prompts for the current project. 

### Adding new prompt

Click on `+ Prompt` (or `OpenAi Playground` if the list is empty); this will redirect you to the
[AI Playground](../translation_process/ai_playground.mdx) with default prompt, which you can edit and save as a custom prompt.

### Managing prompts

Click on the`⋮` icon next to any custom prompt to see a prompt menu.

<ScreenshotWrapper

  src="/img/docs/platform/ai-settings/prompts-menu.webp"
/>

From here you can edit the prompt (redirects to the playground with the selected prompt opened), rename or delete the prompt.

## Context data (formerly AI customization)

:::info
This feature is only available with a Business subscription or higher on Tolgee cloud and Subscribed Self-hosted
instances with [AI translator](/platform/translation_process/ai_translator) enabled as the translation provider.
:::

If you wish to enhance the results from the [AI translator](/platform/translation_process/ai_translator),
you can customize it according to your needs. Tolgee enables you to input key descriptions,
project descriptions, or language notes. This information is provided along with the actual string
that requires translation. It helps to understand the context of your translation project and provide
more accurate translations.

### Providing project description

Project descriptions are beneficial when you have a project in a specific domain.
You can also specify your **overall tone of voice**.
For instance, if you're translating an app for golf players, you can provide description like this:

```text title="Example"
This is an app for golf players.
Please use golf terminology.
Use a friendly tone of voice.
We motivate the players to get better.
```

To provide the project description,

- Select `Languages` in the project menu.
- Select `AI Customization`.
- Click the `+ Description` button in the `Project description` section.

### Providing language notes

Language notes are useful for specifying your conventions for a specific language. You can also use it to specify common terminology.
Sometimes, you might also want to specify the tone of voice for a specific language
if you wish to communicate differently to different cultures.

```text title="Example for Japanese"
In Japanese, we are using polite language. Japanese Golf players are very polite.
Always translate "Golf Club" as ゴルフクラブ, referring to the equipment used to hit the ball, not a group of players.
```

To provide the language description,

- Select `Languages` in the project menu
- Select `AI Customization`
- Click the `+` on the language you want to customize

### Providing a key description

You can read more about providing key descriptions [here](/platform/translation_keys/keys#key-description).
Tolgee uses the same key description for AI translation as the translation editor.
