Once you have created a project and set up the languages, you can add members to your project. Members are the people who will be translating your project.

## Adding members

To add members to your project, navigate to the "Members" page. Then click on the "Invite user" button.
You can add a member by **entering their email address or creating an invitation link** to share with them.

Then you can select the **permissions** you want to give the member. The permissions are explained in the [next section](#permissions).

When you add a member to your project, the **member is automatically added to your organization**.

## Permissions

You can choose the permissions that you want to give to the member. The permissions are:

- **None** – The member cannot access the project. This is useful if you want to hide a project from a member without removing them from the organization.
- **View** – The member can view the project and the translations. The member can also export the translations.
- **Translate** – The member can change the translations in the selected language(s).
- **Review** – The member can change the translations and mark them as reviewed in the selected language(s).
- **Edit** – The member can change the translations, mark them as reviewed, and add new keys.
- **Manage** – The member can manage the project. The member can add and remove members, change the project settings, including languages, and delete the project.

### Granular permissions

:::info Paid feature

Granular permissions are a **paid feature** included in the Business and Enterprise plans. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing) to use this feature.

If you use the self-hosted version, you need to [set up the license](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) to use this feature.

:::

Granular permissions give you **fine-grained control** over what a member can do in your project.

For example, you can give a member permission to change translations in a specific language but only view translations in some other languages for reference.

Or you can give a member permission to view and add screenshots but not delete them. The possibilities are endless here!
