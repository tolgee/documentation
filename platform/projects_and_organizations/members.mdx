Once you have created a project and set up the languages, you can add members to your project.

## Adding members

To add members to your project, navigate to the "Members" page. Then click on the "Invite user" button.
You can add a member by **entering their email address or creating an invitation link** to share with them.

Then you can select the **permissions** you want to give the member. The permissions are explained in the [next section](#permissions).

## Permissions

You can choose the permissions that you want to give to the member. The permissions are:

- **None** – The member cannot access the project. This is useful if you want to hide a project from a member without removing them from the organization.
- **View** – The member can view the project and the translations. The member can also export the translations.
- **Translate** – The member can change the translations in the selected language(s).
- **Review** – The member can change the translations and mark them as reviewed in the selected language(s).
- **Edit** – The member can change the translations, mark them as reviewed, and add new keys.
  The member can also view all recent batch operations in the Translations view and start the "Pre-translate by TM" and "Machine translation" batch operations.
- **Manage** – The member can manage the project. The member can add and remove members, change the project settings, including languages, and delete the project.

### Granular permissions

:::info Feature availability

Granular permissions are available in the Business and Enterprise plans. [Upgrade your plan](https://tolgee.io/pricing) to use this feature.

If you use the self-hosted version, you need to [set up the license](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) to use this feature.

:::

Granular permissions give you **fine-grained control** over what a member can do in your project.

For example, you can give a member permission to change translations in a specific language but only view translations in some other languages for reference.

Or you can give a member permission to view and add screenshots but not delete them. The possibilities are endless here!
