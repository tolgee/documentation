### Editing languages
When opening the Languages settings, you can see the list of all languages in the project. You can **change the base language** in the [project settings](project_settings).

You can edit the language details by clicking on the cog icon in the language list. You can also change the language tag, original name and English name, and flag.
And if you wish to delete the language, you can do so by clicking the `Delete language` button.
