import { ScreenshotWrapper } from '../shared/_ScreenshotWrapper';

In the Tolgee platform, you can manage the languages of your projects. There is a single base language for the project, and
multiple target languages.

## The BCP 47 language tag

Tolgee uses a standard BCP 47 language tag (similar to ISO language codes) to identify languages. When setting up language, we enable you to use custom
language tags. However, we strongly recommend you use BCP-47 language tags, as Tolgee recognizes such languages for
machine translation and other features.

You can read more about the BCP 47 language tag in the official
[RFC: Matching of Language Tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4647.txt)

### How to Add Languages to Your Project

To add a language to the project,
