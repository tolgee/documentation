import { ScreenshotWrapper } from '../shared/_ScreenshotWrapper';


The Tolgee platform allows you to set up custom LLM models. You can do so in the organization section (Cloud version) or globally in the server configuration (Self-hosted version).

In this guide, we'll show setup via the UI, but the fields are mostly identical when you use the server
configuration.

## Configuration via UI

  1. Go to Organization settings
  2. Select LLM Providers in the side menu

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/llm-providers/llm-providers-list.webp"
  alt="new member invitation"
/>

Here, you can see a list of custom providers (configuration is per Organization). You can also see
server-configured providers in the `Server` tab. Server providers cannot be modified via UI.

## Deleting or editing provider

Click on the `⋮` icon next to a provider.

From here, you can select `Edit` or `Delete`.

## Adding custom provider

Click the `+ Provider` button to open a provider dialog.

### Provider naming

The provider name is displayed in the UI, as well as the provider's ID.

If you name a custom provider with the same name as a server provider, you will override it.

If you specify multiple providers with the same name, Tolgee will assume it's the same provider with multiple
deployments, so the platform will load balance between them.

You can also specify `Priority`:
 - LOW - deployment will only be used for batch operations
 - HIGH - deployment will only be used for suggestions

This is useful for load-balancing and avoiding rate limits. Batch operations are repeatable,
but they usually handle more traffic. On the other hand, 
the translation suggestion in the UI is not repeatable.
That's why it makes sense to give suggestions higher priority.

## Provider types

Provider type selects a type of API; it influences what other configuration fields are available
based on the API requirements.

### OpenAi

It is designed to work with the official OpenAI API.

 - `API url`: e.g. "https://api.openai.com"
 - `API key`: specify your OpenAI API key without the `Bearer ` prefix
 - `Model`: specify your model name (e.g., "gpt-4o")
 - `Format`: some older models don't support structured output, but for newer ones, select "json_schema"

#### Using OpenAi API of LM studio

[LM studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) uses OpenAI compatible API, so you can configure Tolgee to use it.

Example configuration:
 - `API url`: e.g. "http://localhost:1234" (default when running lm studio locally)
 - `API key`: empty
 - `Model`: e.g. "gemma-3-4b-it-qat" (name of the model in the lm studio)
 - `Format`: some older models don't support structured output, but for newer ones, select "json_schema"


### Azure OpenAi

It is designed to work with the Azure version of OpenAI API.

 - `API url`: URL of your Azure resource
 - `API key`: resource key
 - `Deployment`: specify your AI Foundry deployment (e.g., gpt-4o)
 - `Format`: some older models don't support structured output, but for newer ones, select "json_schema"

### Anthropic

It is designed to work with the Anthropic API.

 - `API url`: e.g. "https://api.anthropic.com"
 - `API key`: specify your Anthropic API key ("x-api-key" header)
 - `Model`: specify your model name (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Google AI

It is designed to work with the Google AI API.

 - `API url`: e.g. "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"
 - `API key`: specify your Google Console API key ("api-key" header)
 - `Model`: specify your model name (e.g., gemini-2.0-flash)

## Self-hosted server configuration

In the same way as through UI, you can also configure llm providers through server configuration,
when you are self-hosting.

Configuration field [`tolgee.llm.providers`](/platform/self_hosting/configuration#providers),
is an array of providers with following fields:

```
tolgee:
  llm:
    providers:
      - name: string
        type: OPENAI | OPENAI_AZURE | TOLGEE | ANTHROPIC | GOOGLE_AI
        api-url: string
        api-key: string
        model: string
        deployment: string
        format: string (e.g. "json_schema" )
        priority: null | LOW | HIGH
        enabled: true | false (default: true)
```

Fill the fields which are necessary according to the documentation above, you can leave other fields empty.
