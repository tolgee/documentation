## Set up the Content Delivery

Content Delivery will deploy your localization files to a reliable and fast cloud storage, so you can confidently use them in your application. This way, the updates in your localization files can be reflected without changes to your code.


### Go to Developer Settings

### Add new Content Delivery

You can have multiple content deliveries if you need multiple targets in different formats. So name this one accordingly and then adjust your export settings.

By default, you can leave your Content Delivery to be published automatically after a change happens in your application. But you can also choose to do this manually.

### Use the Content Delivery link

Copy the link to your Content Delivery.

The easiest way to connect Content Delivery with Tolgee SDK is through `BackendFetch` plugin.

```tsx
const tolgee = Tolgee()
    ...
    .use(BackendFetch({ prefix: 'https://cdndev.tolg.ee/i18n/b53fb7fb98a57fd1f2ffc85ef5ee7b03' }))
    ...
```


This way your localization files are stored outside your application, so you can update them independently from your release cycle.

:::info
Content delivery is made to be rapidly available all around the world, so we prioritize caching and using CDN over fast deployment. This means it can take up to 15 minutes (usually faster) for your changes to be published.

### Manual publishing

If you opted out of automatic publishing, you can do so manually in the list of content deliveries by `Publish` button.

### Storage file structure

Your localization files are simply named by the language tags in the root folder of your storage link with the file extension (depending on your settings):

```
├── <your Content Delivery link>
│   ├── cs.json
│   └── en.json
```

If you use namespaces, it should look like this:

```
├── <your Content Delivery link>
│   └── common
│       ├── en.json
│       └── de.json
```

## Using custom storage

You can also connect Tolgee to your custom storage.

### Open Content Storage settings

### Add new storage

Tolgee supports S3 buckets and Azure blob storage. Fill in the settings that you obtain from your provider.

You can also test if your configuration is valid with the `Test` button.

### Select the storage in the Content Delivery

After you create custom storage the `Storage` field will appear in Content Delivery settings, so you can select your Storage over the default one.
