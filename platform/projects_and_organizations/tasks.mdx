Tasks allow you to assign and track progress on translating or reviewing jobs.

## Task creation

To create a task go to the `Tasks` section in the project menu and click the `+ Task` button:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/tasks_page_empty.webp"
  alt="Tasks page empty"
/>

You will see a task creation dialog:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/create_task.webp"
  alt="Create task dialog"
/>

Fields description:

- **Type** - the type of the task
  - `Translate` - Expects assignee to fill or update translation
  - `Review` - Expects assignee to change translation state to `Reviewed`
- **Name**
- **Languages** - You can select one or more languages, a separate task for each language will be created
- **Due date** - A date due the task should be completed
- **Description** - Additional information about the task
- **Tasks and assignees**
  - Filters - you can filter by keys or by translation states, this will influence how many keys will be in each task
  - Tasks preview - shows what tasks will be created, with a calculated amount of work. You can also assign users to each task separately. There can be a warning sign, which appears when some keys are omitted because of their state or because the translation is already in a different task with the same type.


> You can also create task through `Batch operation` from the translations view, to manually select keys.

## Working on the task

Once the task is created, each assignee receives an email notification.

He can also see a notification next to his profile icon, where he can go to see his tasks.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_notification.webp"
  alt="Task notification"
/>

Once he clicks on `My tasks`, he can see a list of all tasks assigned to him.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/my_tasks.webp" alt="My tasks" />

To start working on the task, he can click on it and get to a translation view, prefiltered by the task.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_prefilter.webp"
  alt="Translations prefiltered by task"
/>

Now every time the user changes a translation, the translation will be marked as done automatically (`Save & done` button), you can also change the `done` state by task button on the right side of the translation (it changes its color when the translation is done).

> The same logic works with `Review` tasks, with the `Mark as reviewed` button.

## User permissions

If you assign task to a user which has read only rights to the project, his rights will be elevated to allow him to finish the task. In case of `Translate` task, he can edit the translation and add comments (similarly with `Review` tasks, he can change the review state). 

He'll only has these rights until the task is `Done` or `Closed`.

## Task state and progress

Each task has four states:

- `New` - nothing has been done on the task
- `In progress` - at least one translation has been marked as `done`
- `Done` - Once all translations are done, the user is prompted to mark the whole task as `Done`, this signifies that there will be no further work on the task
- `Closed` at any time task can be closed - meaning the task is not relevant anymore

To see an overview of tasks progress for a project, go to the tasks section in the project menu.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/project_tasks.webp"
  alt="Project tasks progress"
/>

In the basic view, you can see all the tasks that are `New` or `In progress`, `Done` tasks are only visible for `30 days`. To see older `Done` tasks and `Closed` tasks, check the `Closed tasks` checkbox.

If you want to see tasks categorized by their state, you can switch to a `Board` view:

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/project_tasks_board.webp"
  alt="Project tasks board view"
/>

## Task actions

To manage tasks, use the task menu.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_menu.webp"
  alt="Task menu"
/>

- `Mark as done` - can be only used when the task is completed (progress is 100%)
- `Close task` - can be used any time
- `Clone to new task` - used to create the same task for different language
- `Create review task` - use to create a follow-up review task
- `Generate report` - generates Excel detailed report - useful when you want to see, how much work has been done on the task and by who

## Task detail

To see project details, use the button with the task icon.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_detail_button.webp"
  alt="Task detail button"
/>

Task detail allows you to see all the information about the task and also change assignees and other task details.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_detail.webp"
  alt="Task detail"
/>

If add new assignees, they will recieve notification email, similarly as when the task is created.

## Task batch operations

You can create task directly from batch operations, to select exectly which keys should be included. Or you can add the keys to an existing task.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_batch_operations.webp"
  alt="Task batch operations"
/>

To remove keys from a task, you can filter by task and then go to batch operations menu, and a `Remove keys from task` option will appear.

<ScreenshotWrapper
  src="/img/docs/platform/tasks/task_batch_op_remove.webp"
  alt="Task remove keys"
/>
