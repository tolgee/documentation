Glossaries help you maintain consistent terminology across your translations.
You can create glossaries at the organization level and assign them to projects.

## Managing Glossaries

This section describes how to work with glossaries and the terms in them.

### Accessing Glossaries

Here, you can see a list of glossaries in your organization.

1. Go to Organization settings
2. Select Glossaries in the side menu

It is important to note that a user can see all glossaries if they have access to any project within the organization.

The user can add a glossary and edit it if the access is set to at least a maintainer. You can edit the user's project access in the [Organization members](/platform/projects_and_organizations/organization_settings#organization-members) tab.

### Creating a Glossary

1. Click the `+ Glossary` button to open the dialog window to create the glossary
2. Enter a name for the glossary
3. Assign the glossary to projects (it is optional but essential for working with glossaries properly)
4. Select a base language
5. Click `Create`
6. Next, you can add the terms with "+ Term" button

The base language and the glossary languages are derived from the projects that were assigned to the glossary. The languages can be added to the project themselves, and then they will be automatically assigned.

### Adding Terms to a Glossary

1. In the glossary detail view, click the `+ Term` button
2. Enter the term text
3. Add a description
4. Tick the checkboxes as needed to add the tags:
   - Non-translatable: Indicates that the term should not be translated (in this case, you will not be able to click on the translations in the glossary)
   - Case-sensitive: Indicates that the term's case should be preserved
   - Abbreviation: Indicates that the term is an abbreviation
   - Forbidden term: Indicates that the term should not be used
5. Click `Save`

### Importing Terms to a Glossary

1. After creating a new glossary, click the `Import glossary` button
2. Select a CSV file in the recommended format
3. Choose an option for how you want to import your terms to the glossary:
   - Replace glossary
   - Add to glossary 
4. Click `Import`

#### Import to an empty glossary

#### Import to an existing glossary
<ScreenshotWrapper

  alt="Import a glossary from a CSV file"
/>

#### Import with an option Replace glossary
Choose this option if you want to delete all existing terms and import new ones from the CSV file. It is useful if you have a CSV file as your source of truth.

  alt="Import with an option Replace glossary"
/>


#### Import with an option Add to glossary
Choose this option if you want to add new terms from your CSV file to the glossary. It is useful if you have new terms and want to add them in bulk to the glossary. Do not use this option for CSV files with terms that already exist in the glossary, as this might create duplicates. By the definition of the glossary, there can be multiple identical terms with different meanings, so existing terms are not replaced.

#### Format of the CSV

Ensure that the CSV file meets the recommended format. Copy the structure of the columns:
- **term** - the term itself in the base language
- **description** - description of the term's meaning. This will help translators or AI understand the term better
- **translatable** - indicates whether the term is untranslatable (term is the same in all languages) or translatable (translation is different)
- **casesensitive** - indicates the case matters
- **abbreviation** - indicates the term is an abbreviation
- **forbidden** - indicates the term is forbidden
- **language columns** - use the language tag (short form) for languages used in the projects

To see the terms of your glossary, click on the glossary you want in the list of all glossaries, and then you will be able to view the glossary terms.

From here, you can:
- Add new terms
- Edit existing terms
- Translate existing terms
- Delete terms
- Search for terms

To edit or add a term translation, click on the cell in the desired language column.

To edit a term or its details like the tags or the description, click on the term cell in its base language column (the first column).

### Editing Terms

1. Open the details of the term by clicking on the first column
2. Update the term details
3. Click `Save`

### Translating Terms

1. Add the desired language to the list of languages in the top right corner next to the `+ Term` button
2. Click on the translation cell for the desired language
3. Enter the translation for the term
4. Click Save

This will not work if the base language term has a "Non-translatable" tag as it will stay the same in all languages.

After you have defined your glossary, you can start to use it. Read more about how to use glossaries in the translation process in [Glossary in translation view](/platform/translation_process/using_glossaries_in_translations_view).
