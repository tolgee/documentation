Glossaries help you maintain consistent terminology across your translations.
You can create glossaries at the organization level and assign them to projects.

## Managing Glossaries

This section describes how to work with glossaries and the terms in them.

### Accessing Glossaries

Here, you can see a list of glossaries in your organization.

1. Go to Organization settings
2. Select Glossaries in the side menu

It is important to note that a user can see all glossaries if they have access to any project within the organization.

The user can add a glossary and edit it if the access is set to at least a maintainer. You can edit the user's project access in the [Organization members](/platform/projects_and_organizations/organization_settings#organization-members) tab.

### Creating a Glossary

1. Click the `+ Glossary` button to open the dialog window to create the glossary
2. Enter a name for the glossary
3. Assign the glossary to projects (it is optional but essential for working with glossaries properly)
4. Select a base language
5. Click `Create`
6. Next, you can add the terms with "+ Term" button

The base language and the glossary languages are derived from the projects that were assigned to the glossary. The languages can be added to the project themselves, and then they will be automatically assigned.

   - Abbreviation: Indicates that the term is an abbreviation

From here, you can:
- Add new terms

To edit or add a term translation, click on the cell in the desired language column.

To edit a term or its details like the tags or the description, click on the term cell in its base language column (the first column).

### Editing Terms

### Translating Terms

1. Add the desired language to the list of languages in the top right corner next to the `+ Term` button
