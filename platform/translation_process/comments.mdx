Comments are a great way to collaborate inside Tolgee. Users can ask questions, ask for context, suggest changes to the translation, or just leave a comment for individual translations of keys.
You can also reply to comments and mark them as resolved.

If a translation has a comment, the comment icon will be displayed next to the key with the number of comments.

## Replying to comments

To reply to a comment, click on the comment icon next to the translation. You will see a list of comments. Then type your reply and click on the Send button.

When you feel that the comment is resolved, you can mark it as resolved. To do that, simply click on the `✔️` icon next to the comment.
