Comments are a great way to collaborate inside Tolgee. Users can ask questions, ask for context, suggest changes to the translation, or just leave a comment for individual translations of keys.
You can also reply to comments and mark them as resolved.

If a translation has a comment, the comment icon will be displayed next to the key with the number of comments.

## Replying to comments

To reply to a comment, click on the comment icon next to the translation. You will see a list of comments. Then type your reply and click on the Send button.

## Resolving comments

When you feel that the comment is resolved, you can mark it as resolved. To do that, simply click on the `✔️` icon next to the comment.
