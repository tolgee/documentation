Notifications keep you up to date with everything important that you should not miss.

A notification is created when:

* Your password is changed.
* Multi-factor authentication is enabled or disabled for your account.
* A task is assigned to you (if tasks are enabled).
* A task you created is closed or completed (if tasks are enabled).

There are two types of notifications:

* In-app notifications
* Email notifications

Notifications can be disabled in the settings.
By default, all notifications are enabled.

## In-app Notifications

                   alt="Notifications bell"/>

In-app notifications can be viewed by clicking the bell icon in the top right corner of the screen.

The number on the bell icon indicates the count of unseen notifications.

                   alt="Notifications pop-up"/>

Clicking a notification redirects you to the relevant page, such as the associated task.

In-app notifications can be disabled in the settings.

## Email Notifications

If enabled, email notifications are sent to the user's registered email address.

<ScreenshotWrapper src="/img/docs/platform/notifications/notifications_email.webp"
                   alt="Notifications email"/>

Email notifications can be disabled in the settings.

## Notification Settings

Notifications can be enabled or disabled per type and channel.

The settings page can be found in the account settings.

Security notifications are always enabled.
