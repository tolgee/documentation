AI Translator is based on ChatGPT and can translate with included screenshots, [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk#automatic-context-collection),
key description, project description, language notes and results from the translation memory.

## AI Translator with context

:::info
This functionality is available only in the Cloud version with SDK 5.9.0 and higher.
:::

Tolgee Context is a statistic about relations between the keys based on how they are laid out in your application.
Context is gathered by Tolgee SDK. [Read more.](/js-sdk#automatic-context-collection)

_With Tolgee Context, ambiguous translations can be improved radically._

The presence of context for the given key is indicated at the bottom left corner of the key
cell with a little ⚡ icon. By clicking on the icon, you can see the context.

## AI Translator customization

You can customize the AI Translator via [AI Playground](./ai_playground.mdx)
(customizing translating prompt). Or simply provide project and language descriptions
[AI Translator Customization section](/platform/projects_and_organizations/ai-settings#context-data-formerly-ai-customization).
