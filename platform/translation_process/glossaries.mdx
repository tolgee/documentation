Glossaries help you maintain consistent terminology when translating your content.
When you translate a string that contains glossary terms,
these terms are highlighted, and their definitions are displayed in the glossary panel while editing translations.

## Glossary Terms highlights

When you open a translation that contains glossary terms, these terms are highlighted in the base text.

Hovering over highlights will display a tooltip containing the term, its suggested translation, description and flags.

## Glossary Panel

The glossary panel shows all glossary terms found in the base text in the right sidebar. For each term, you can see:

- The term text
- Any flags associated with the term (non-translatable, case-sensitive, abbreviation, forbidden)
- The term description when hovering over the `(i)` icon

## Using Glossary Terms

When translating content with glossary terms:

1. Check the glossary panel to see the terms and their descriptions
2. Pay attention to the flags:
   - Non-translatable: Do not translate these terms
   - Case-sensitive: Maintain the same case in your translation
   - Abbreviation: Keep the abbreviation format
   - Forbidden: Avoid using these terms in your translation

## Glossary Terms matching

When searching for glossary terms in the translation, Tolgee tries to match the whole term against the translation in a case-insensitive way.

The flags affect the process in the following ways:

- **Case-sensitive**: When set, the system will only match the term if it has the exact same case as defined in the glossary. For example, "API" will not match "api" if a case-sensitive flag is set.
- **Non-translatable**: When enabled, the translation of the term in the base language will be used for all languages, regardless of the target language.
- **Abbreviation** and **Forbidden**: These flags have no effect on the search process itself but still provide guidance for both human and AI translators.

## Machine Translation and Glossaries

When using machine translation, the glossary terms are taken into account. This helps ensure that:

- Non-translatable terms remain untranslated
- Terminology is consistent across all translations
