Machine translation (MT) is a way to translate content using external services.
It is a great way to speed up the translation process and to get a rough translation of the content.

:::info Feature availability
Machine translation is available on both Tolgee Cloud and self-hosted instances.

For self-hosted instances, you can either [purchase a plan](/platform/self_hosting/licensing) to get pre-configured providers, or provide your own API keys. See the [configuration documentation](/platform/self_hosting/configuration#tolgee-_-machine-translation) for details.
