Machine translation (MT) is a way to translate content using external services.
It is a great way to speed up the translation process and to get a rough translation of the content.

## Machine translation providers

Currently, we support the following machine translation providers:

- Google Translate
- Amazon Translate (AWS)
- DeepL
- Microsoft Azure Translator
- [Tolgee Translator](tolgee_translator)

## Machine translation suggestions

Machine translation suggestions are available in the translation editor.

Note that only the machine translation providers **enabled by the project administrator** will be displayed.
