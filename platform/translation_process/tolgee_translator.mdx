Tolgee Translator is based on ChatGPT and can translate with included [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context),
key description, project description, language notes and results from the translation memory.

## Tolgee Translator with context

:::info
This functionality is available only in the Cloud version with SDK 5.9.0 and higher.
:::

Tolgee Context is a statistic about relations between the keys based on how they are laid out in your application.
Context is gathered by Tolgee SDK. [Read more.](/js-sdk/tolgee_context)

_With [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context), ambiguous translations can be improved radically._

The presence of context for the given key is indicated at the bottom left corner of the key cell and at the Tolgee
Translator icon with a little ⚡ icon. By clicking on the icon, you can see the context.

## Tolgee Translator without context

Tolgee Translator can improve the quality of translation even without the [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context).
It knows the key name, it can be enhanced with key description, project descriptions and language notes.
Also, it gets access to the [translation memory](/platform/translation_process/translation_memory),
so if there are similar translations, it will keep it consistent.

_Tolgee Translator can help maintain consistency with other translations if translation memory is available._

It can essentially see the same information as a human translator (when screenshots are replaced by [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context)).

## Tolgee Translator customization

You can customize the Tolgee Translator to your needs. Read more about that in the
[AI Translator Customization section](/platform/projects_and_organizations/ai-translation-customization).
