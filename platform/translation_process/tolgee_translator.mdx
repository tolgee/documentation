This functionality is available only in the Cloud version with SDK 5.9.0 and higher.

Tolgee Translator is based on ChatGPT and can translate with included [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context). Tolgee Context is a statistic about relations between the keys based on how they are laid out in your application. Context is gathered by Tolgee SDK ([read more](/js-sdk/tolgee_context)).

_With [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context), ambiguous translations can be improved radically._

The presence of context for the given key is indicated at the bottom left corner of the key cell and at the Tolgee Translator icon with a little âš¡ icon.

## Tolgee Translator without context

Tolgee Translator can improve the quality of translation even without the [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context). It knows that you are translating a software product, and it gets access to the translation memory. So if there are similar translations, it will keep it consistent.

It also knows the translation key, which can also contribute to better translation.

_Tolgee Translator can help maintain consistency with other translations if translation memory is available._

It can essentially see the same information as a human translator (when screenshots are replaced by [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk/tolgee_context)).
