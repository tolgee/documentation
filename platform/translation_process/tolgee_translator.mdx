Tolgee Translator is based on ChatGPT and can translate with included [Tolgee Context](/js-sdk#automatic-context-collection),
key description, project description, language notes and results from the translation memory.

## Tolgee Translator with context

:::info
This functionality is available only in the Cloud version with SDK 5.9.0 and higher.
:::

Tolgee Context is a statistic about relations between the keys based on how they are laid out in your application.
Context is gathered by Tolgee SDK. [Read more.](/js-sdk#automatic-context-collection)

_With Tolgee Context, ambiguous translations can be improved radically._

The presence of context for the given key is indicated at the bottom left corner of the key cell and at the Tolgee
Translator icon with a little âš¡ icon. By clicking on the icon, you can see the context.

## Tolgee Translator without context

Tolgee Translator can improve the quality of translation even without the Tolgee Context.
It knows the key name, it can be enhanced with key description, project descriptions and language notes.
Also, it gets access to the [translation memory](/platform/translation_process/translation_memory),
so if there are similar translations, it will keep it consistent.

_Tolgee Translator can help maintain consistency with other translations if translation memory is available._

It can essentially see the same information as a human translator (when screenshots are replaced by Tolgee Context.
