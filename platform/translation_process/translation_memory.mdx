Translation memory (TM) searches for similar texts in your project and suggests them to you. This helps you to reuse translations and save time.

## Translation memory matches

Translation memory matches are shown in the editor. Suggestions with match percentages lower than 50% won't be displayed.

For each TM match, the following information is shown:

- Translation of the base text
- Base text
- Match percentage (similarity)
- Key name

To add the TM match to the editor, simply click on the suggestion.
