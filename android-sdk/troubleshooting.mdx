## Translations Not Loading

- Ensure you have the correct Content Delivery URL
- Check that your storage provider is properly configured
- Make sure you're calling `Tolgee.init` before accessing translations
- Use `tolgee.preload` or `tolgee.tFlow` before calling `tolgee.t` to ensure translations are loaded

### CDN/Network

- If using Tolgee Cloud, verify your `network_security.xml` includes `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` domains and that the `AndroidManifest.xml` references it via `android:networkSecurityConfig`.
- If self-hosting, replace CDN URL with your domain and allow it in `network_security.xml`.
- Test connectivity to the CDN URL prefix in a browser/curl to ensure it returns JSON bundles.

## Locale Issues

- Verify that your project supports the locale code you're using
- Check that translations for the selected locale exist in your Tolgee project
- Use `tolgee.changeFlow` to monitor locale changes and update your UI accordingly

## Android Integration Issues

- Ensure that the `TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid` is properly initialized with the context and version code which changes with each app update
- Check that your Android resources are properly structured - Tolgee is using `resources.getResourceEntryName` to find key for the resource

## Compose-specific Issues

- Use `stringResource` and `pluralStringResource` from the Tolgee package in composables.
- Collect `tolgee.changeFlow` with `collectAsState` to trigger recomposition on locale/translation updates.
- Avoid creating Tolgee instances inside composables; hoist to application scope.

## Version Mismatch

- Make sure your app uses a consistent `tolgeeVersion` across `core` and `compose` artifacts.
- If you migrated formats, confirm formatter configuration matches your data (e.g., `Sprintf` vs `ICU`).
