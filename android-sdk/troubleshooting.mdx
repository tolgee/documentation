## Translations Not Loading

- Ensure you have the correct Content Delivery URL
- Check that your storage provider is properly configured
- Make sure you're calling `Tolgee.init` before accessing translations
- Use `tolgee.preload` or `tolgee.tFlow` before calling `tolgee.t` to ensure translations are loaded

## Locale Issues

- Verify that your project supports the locale code you're using
- Check that translations for the selected locale exist in your Tolgee project
- Use `tolgee.changeFlow` to monitor locale changes and update your UI accordingly

## Android Integration Issues

- Ensure that the `TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid` is properly initialized with the context and version code which changes with each app update
- Check that your Android resources are properly structured - Tolgee is using `resources.getResourceEntryName` to find key for the resource
