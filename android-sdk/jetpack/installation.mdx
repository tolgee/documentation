# Quickstart (Compose Module)

This guide shows you how to integrate Tolgee Android SDK using the **Compose module** for Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform.

The Compose module is Android's modern **declarative UI toolkit**; it's a **simpler** and **more reactive model** compared to Core module. It provides you with **instant access to Tolgee translations** directly in Composables/Compose Multiplatform projects, with **automatic updates**.
:::info
For managing static translations, we recommend using [Tolgee CLI](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli).
:::

## Requirements

<AndroidApiRequirement />

## Dependency Setup

:::info
Using **Version Catalog** is recommended to keep your versions aligned, especially in bigger projects. This provides **readability, centralization, and consistency**.

:::note
Configuration exaples below are written in Kotlin DSL. Groovy DSL should work but is not officially supported/tested.
:::

1. Add dependency (Compose):

In `gradle/libs.versions.toml` **add an alias for Tolgee Compose library**.

```toml
[libraries]
tolgee = { group = "io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk", name = "compose", version.ref = "tolgee" }
```

Then, in `build.gradle.kts`, **use the created alias**.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.tolgee)
}
```

For **smaller projects** you can also add dependency directly (the old way).

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:compose:tolgee")
}
```

:::note
If you use **traditional Android Views**, see the Core variant: [Core Quickstart](/android-sdk/core-module/quickstart)
:::

2. (If needed) Ensure repositories include Maven Central in `settings.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
pluginManagement { repositories { gradlePluginPortal(); google(); mavenCentral() } }
dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories { google(); mavenCentral() } }
```

Make sure your repositories are configured to include **Maven Central** for dependency resolution.
If you encounter an error like:

```text
Could not find io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:compose
```

verify that Maven Central is included in your repository configuration.

3. Allow CDN networking:

:::info
Allowing `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` domains is required when using Tolgee Cloud CDN. If you access your own self-hosted CDN, here is where you should add the domain of your CDN.
:::

Create a network security config file `network_security.xml` in your `res/xml` folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <domain-config>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolgee.io</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolg.ee</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Add network security config to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security"> <!-- Add this line to your existing application tag -->
</application>
```

:::note
Allowing `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` domains is required when using Tolgee Cloud CDN. If you only access your own self-hosted CDN, include your domain(s) accordingly.
:::

## Initialization and configuration

Initialize Tolgee in your `Application` class.

### Android (Jetpack Compose)

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Tolgee.init {
            contentDelivery {
                url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix" // from Tolgee Platform → Content Delivery
                storage = TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid(this@MyApplication, BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE) // cache invalidates on app update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiplatform

```kotlin
fun initTolgee() {
    Tolgee.init {
        contentDelivery {
            url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix"
            // Create a custom storage provider for caching the latest translations from CDN if needed
        }
    }
}
```

When your app boots up, Tolgee is globally initialized. The translations are downloaded from CDN and cached locally. Your Compose components can now use Tolgee without additional configuration.

**_Make sure that your app knows where to download translations_**:

For your app to download translation files, you need to provide a CDN URL prefix specific to your project. This prefix points to the catalog that contains your app's translations.

### How to get your CDN URL prefix (Content Delivery):

1. Open Tolgee Platform → your Project → Developer settings → Content Delivery(Add).
2. Copy the full CDN URL prefix.
3. You can use different prefixes per environment (dev/staging/prod).

### Optional: Verify connectivity locally:

```bash
curl -I "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix/en.json"
```

You should receive a 200 response.
If you get 403 (Forbidden) or 404 (Not found), double‑check the prefix.

:::tip
Compose advantage: No context wrapping needed
:::

Unlike traditional Android Views, Compose uses its own `stringResource`/`pluralStringResource` helpers, so no `ContextWrapper` is needed for automatic translation updates.

:::note
If you have a different integration setup (for example, using tolgee-cli and bundling JSON translation files in assets), the initialization may look different.
