## Translations Not Updating

- Ensure you're using the `stringResource` and `pluralStringResource` functions from the Tolgee package
- Check that your Tolgee instance is properly initialized
- Verify that the translations are loaded correctly (preload or make sure you're using flow-based API - `tFlow` / `stringResource`)

## Android Resource Integration Issues

- Check that your Android resources are properly structured - Tolgee is using `resources.getResourceEntryName` to find key for the resource
- Ensure that the Tolgee instance has access to the Android context

## Compose Multiplatform Issues

- Verify that your resource files are correctly set up and all keys present in resources are present in a Tolgee platform too
- Ensure that you're using the correct resource references

## Best practices for Compose

- Hoist Tolgee instance at the application level; avoid creating it in composables.
- Use `collectAsState` on `changeFlow` to recompose on locale/translation updates.
- Prefer `stringResource`/`pluralStringResource` helpers for readability.

## CDN/Network

- If using Tolgee Cloud, ensure `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` are allowed in `res/xml/network_security.xml` and referenced via `android:networkSecurityConfig`.
- For selfâ€‘hosting, replace the CDN URL with your domain and allow it in `network_security.xml`.
- Quick connectivity test:

```bash
curl -I "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix/en.json"
```
