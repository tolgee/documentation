# Tolgee Android SDK

## Overview

Tolgee Android SDK provides localization support for Kotlin-based projects, with a primary focus on Android applications. It enables **Over-the-Air (OTA)** translation updates, allowing you to deliver new or updated translations at runtime **without rebuilding or publishing a new version of your app**.

Once integrated, the SDK handles fetching and applying translations dynamically, so developers no longer need to manually manage string resources, export localization files, or coordinate translation updates through app releases.

The SDK integrates seamlessly with both **Android Views** and **Jetpack Compose**, supports reactive locale changes, and is built with **Kotlin Multiplatform** compatibility in mind.

## Features

### Over-the-Air (OTA) Content Delivery

Update translations dynamically at runtime. Save a lot of time when releasing new or updated translations. No need to wait for them to be published via Google Play or App Store.

### Multiple format support

- **Android XML format** with [sprintf-style placeholders](/platform/formats/android_xml) (`%s`, `%d`, etc.)
- **ICU Message Format** with [Tolgee Universal ICU placeholders](/platform/translation_process/icu_message_format) (advanced formatting)

### Compose integration

Full integration with Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform

### Kotlin Multiplatform support

Designed with multiplatform projects in mind.

### Flexible hosting options

Connect to [Tolgee Cloud](/platform/) or [self-hosted](/platform/self_hosting/getting_started) instances.

## Next steps
- Install and configure the SDK: [Installation](./installation)
- Connect your app to the Tolgee Platform and manage translations collaboratively: [Platform docs](../platform/)
- Generate or manage static strings with CLI: [Tolgee CLI](/tolgee-cli)
