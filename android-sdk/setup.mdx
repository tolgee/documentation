# Setup

After installing the Tolgee SDK, you need to initialize it in your application. This one-time setup process:

- Configures the SDK to connect to your translation content delivery network (CDN)
- Sets up local caching for offline access and performance
- Establishes the global Tolgee instance that your entire app can access
- Enables over-the-air translation updates without releasing a new app version

Once properly initialized, Tolgee will automatically handle translation fetching, caching, and updates throughout your application's lifecycle.

## Initialization Configuration

:::note Universal Setup
This initialization applies to **all Tolgee Android SDK variants** - Android Views (Core), Jetpack Compose, and Kotlin Multiplatform.
:::

### Android

Initialize Tolgee in your `Application` class:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Tolgee.init {
            contentDelivery {
                url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix" // from Tolgee Platform → Content Delivery
                storage = TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid(this@MyApplication, BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE) // cache invalidates on app update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure that your app knows where to download translations

**For your app to download translation files, you need to provide a CDN URL prefix specific to your project.**
This prefix points to the catalog that contains your app's translations.

**To get your CDN URL prefix:**

1. Open **Tolgee Platform → your Project → Developer settings → [Content Delivery](/platform/projects_and_organizations/content_delivery)**
2. Copy the full CDN URL prefix
3. You can use different prefixes per environment (dev/staging/prod)

:::info
If you have a different integration setup (for example, using tolgee-cli and bundling JSON translation files in assets), the initialization may look different.
:::

### Kotlin Multiplatform (Non-Android Targets)

For non-Android targets in Kotlin Multiplatform projects, initialization is similar but requires a custom storage provider:

```kotlin
fun initTolgee() {
    Tolgee.init {
        contentDelivery {
            url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix"
            // Create a custom storage provider for caching the latest translations from CDN if needed
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
You'll need to implement your own storage provider for non-Android platforms to enable caching of translations.
:::

## Alternative Setup: Using Static Data

If you prefer to bundle translations with your app or need offline-first capabilities, you can use [Tolgee CLI](/tolgee-cli/installation) to manage translations as static files.


:::tip
Using Tolgee CLI with static files is ideal for:
- Offline-first applications
- Apps with strict security requirements
- Development environments without internet access
- CI/CD pipelines that need deterministic builds
