# Reccomendations

This guide summarizes recommendations for using Tolgee Android SDK in production.

## Best Practices

### Jetpack Compose

- Use Tolgee’s helpers: `io.tolgee.compose.stringResource` and `pluralStringResource`.
- Subscribe to `tolgee.changeFlow` and collect with `collectAsState` to trigger automatic recomposition on locale change.
- Always tie `remember` with cached translations to the current locale (you may also call `stringResource` directly).
- Preload translations (`tolgee.preload()`) on critical screens so strings are ready sooner for current locale.

### Android Views

- Initialize Tolgee once in `Application` with `applicationContext`.
- Use `ViewModel` + `LiveData/Flow` to observe translation changes and update views reactively.
- Call `tolgee.setLocale("xx")` to switch language, and rely on observers—no activity restart needed.
- Do not hardcode translations in static fields or singletons—always fetch dynamically via Tolgee.
- Preload translations during onboarding/login to avoid showing empty or fallback texts.

## General Production Hygiene

**Single source of truth**: One Tolgee instance (DI/singleton) created, initialized in `Application` with `applicationContext`.

**Release build checks**: Test early with `minifyEnabled true` + `shrinkResources true`; verify translations render as expected in `Release`.

**R8/ProGuard rules**: Keep Tolgee classes when needed by reflection and keep dynamically referenced resources (e.g., using `tools:keep`).

**Network security**: Use HTTPS; include `network_security.xml` and mention it in the manifest; allow `tolg.ee / tolgee.io` domains.

**CDN health**: Monitor CDN prefix correctness; (optional test: curl -I https://cdn.tolg.ee/[prefix]/en.json).

**String synchronization in CI**: Compare keys used in code/resources with Tolgee Platform.

**Caching strategy**: Save with `BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE` so app updates make out-of-date translation caches obsolete.

**Preload critical paths**: Preload on `splash/login` so first paint is from cache; load updates in background.

**Observability**: Log missing strings clearly in debug.

**Accessibility & i18n QA**: Test long strings (DE/RU), RTL (AR/HE), and narrow screens; content descriptions and talkback labels must be localized.

**Formatting discipline**: Each project should have one formatter type (ICU for %s/%d or Sprintf for %s/%d) and consistent translations.

**Offline behavior**: Design fallbacks when CDN is unavailable; ensure cached translations are used.
