description: Quick start guide for Tolgee Android SDK with Core module (traditional Android Views)
---

import AndroidApiRequirement from '@site/src/component/AndroidApiRequirement';

:::info
For managing static translations, we recommend using [Tolgee CLI](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli).
:::

## Quickstart

The Tolgee **Core module** is a library that **simplifies the translation process and provides runtime support for translations in your app**.
This guide shows you how to **integrate Tolgee Android SDK** using the **Core module** for traditional **Android Views**.

### Integration Steps

To use Tolgee in your Android Views application, follow these steps:

1. **Add dependency**
2. **Include Maven Central in repositories** (if needed)
3. **Allow CDN networking**
4. **Initialize Tolgee**

:::note
Configuration examples below are written in Kotlin DSL. Groovy DSL should work but is not officially supported/tested.

## Installing Tolgee Core

:::info
Using **Version Catalog** is recommended to keep your versions aligned, especially in bigger projects.
This **provides readability, centralization, and consistency**.
:::

**1. Add dependency (Core):**

**The translations in your code depend on the base Tolgee library**, which is responsible for fetching and querying them.
**To use the library, you need to add the dependency to your project.**

**In `gradle/libs.versions.toml` add an alias for Tolgee library**:

```toml
[libraries]
tolgee = { group = "io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk", name = "core", version.ref = "tolgee" }
```

Then, **in `build.gradle.kts`, use the created alias**:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.tolgee)
}
```

For **smaller projects**, you can also add the dependency directly:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:core:tolgee")
}
```

:::note
If you use **Jetpack Compose**, see the Compose variant: [Jetpack Compose -> Quickstart](/android-sdk/jetpack/quickstart)
:::

**2. (If needed) Ensure repositories include Maven Central**

When you add a dependency, **your app needs to know where to download the library from**. So, make sure your repositories are configured to **include Maven Central for dependency resolution**.

**In `settings.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle.kts`, add:**

```kotlin
pluginManagement { repositories { gradlePluginPortal(); google(); mavenCentral() } }
dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories { google(); mavenCentral() } }
```

If you encounter an error like:

```text
Could not find io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:core
```

verify that Maven Central is included in your repository configuration.

**3. Allow CDN networking**

**Enable Tolgee to fetch translations from the cloud at runtime**. To do this, you need to **configure network access**.

:::info
Allowing `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` domains is required when using Tolgee Cloud CDN.
If you access your own self-hosted CDN, here is where you should add the domain of your CDN.
:::

**Create a network security config file `network_security.xml` in your `res/xml` folder:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <domain-config>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolgee.io</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolg.ee</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

In Android, **the network security config must be explicitly linked in your `AndroidManifest.xml`**, so the system knows to apply it.

**Add network security config to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:**

```xml
<application
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security"> <!-- Add this line to your existing application tag -->
</application>
```

## Initialization And Configuration

When your app boots up, Tolgee is globally initialized.
The translations are downloaded from CDN and cached locally.
After initialization, other parts of your app (such as activities and fragments) can use Tolgee without additional configuration.

**Initialize Tolgee in your `Application` class:**

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Tolgee.init {
            contentDelivery {
                url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix" // from Tolgee Platform → Content Delivery
                storage = TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid(this@MyApplication, BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE) // cache invalidates on app update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**_Make sure that your app knows where to download translations_**:

**For your app to download translation files, you need to provide a CDN URL prefix specific to your project.**
This prefix points to the catalog that contains your app's translations.

**To get your CDN URL prefix:**

1. Open **Tolgee Platform → your Project → Developer settings → Content Delivery (Add)**
2. Copy the full CDN URL prefix
3. You can use different prefixes per environment (dev/staging/prod)

:::info
If you have a different integration setup (for example, using tolgee-cli and bundling JSON translation files in assets), the initialization may look different.
:::

### Other Platforms

For non-Android platforms, initialization is similar but no storage provider is implemented:

```kotlin
fun initTolgee() {
    Tolgee.init {
        contentDelivery {
            url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix"
            // Create a custom storage provider for caching the latest translations from CDN if needed
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
If you want to implement your own storage provider, do it here.
:::

### Verify connectivity (optional)

You can verify your CDN connection locally:

```bash
curl -I "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix/en.json"
```

You should receive a **200** response.

If you get **403** (Forbidden) or **404** (Not found), **double‑check the prefix**.
