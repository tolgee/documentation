import AndroidApiRequirement from '@site/src/component/AndroidApiRequirement';

:::info
For managing static translations, we recommend using [Tolgee CLI](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-cli).

## Requirements

## Quickstart

This guide shows you how to integrate Tolgee Android SDK using the **Core module** for traditional Android Views. The **Core module** is a library that provides runtime support for Tolgee translations in your app.
:::info
Using **Version Catalog** is recommended to keep your versions aligned, especially in bigger projects. This provides **readability, centralization, and consistency**.
:::

:::note
Configuration exaples below are written in Kotlin DSL. Groovy DSL should work but is not officially supported/tested.
:::

### 1. Add dependency (Core):

In `gradle/libs.versions.toml` **add an alias for Tolgee library**.

```toml
[libraries]
tolgee = { group = "io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk", name = "core", version.ref = "tolgee" }
```

Then, in `build.gradle.kts`, **use the created alias**.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.tolgee)
}
```

For **smaller projects** you can also add dependency directly (the old way).

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:core:tolgee")
}
```

:::note
If you use **Jetpack Compose**, see the Compose variant: [Jetpack Compose -> Quickstart](/android-sdk/jetpack/quickstart)
:::

### 2. (If needed) Ensure repositories include Maven Central in `settings.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
pluginManagement { repositories { gradlePluginPortal(); google(); mavenCentral() } }
dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories { google(); mavenCentral() } }
```

Make sure your repositories are configured to include **Maven Central** for dependency resolution.
If you encounter an error like:

```text
Could not find io.tolgee.mobile-kotlin-sdk:core
```

verify that Maven Central is included in your repository configuration.

### 3. Allow CDN networking:

:::info
Allowing `tolgee.io` and `tolg.ee` domains is required when using Tolgee Cloud CDN. If you access your own self-hosted CDN, here is where you should add the domain of your CDN.
:::

   Create a network security config file `network_security.xml` in your `res/xml` folder:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <domain-config>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolgee.io</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">tolg.ee</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Add network security config to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application
        android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security"> <!-- Add this line to your existing application tag -->
</application>
```

## Initialization and configuration

### Initialize Tolgee in your `Application` class.

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Tolgee.init {
            contentDelivery {
                url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix" // from Tolgee Platform → Content Delivery
                storage = TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid(this@MyApplication, BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE) // cache invalidates on app update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When your app boots up, Tolgee is globally initialized. The translations are downloaded from CDN and cached locally. Other parts of your app (such as activities and fragments) can now use Tolgee without additional configuration.

**_Make sure that your app knows where to download translations_**:

For your app to download translation files, you need to provide a CDN URL prefix specific to your project. This prefix points to the catalog that contains your app’s translations.

### How to get your CDN URL prefix (Content Delivery):

1. Open Tolgee Platform → your Project → Developer settings → Content Delivery(Add).
2. Copy the full CDN URL prefix.
3. You can use different prefixes per environment (dev/staging/prod).

:::info
If you have a different integration setup (for example, using tolgee-cli and bundling JSON translation files in assets), the initialization may look different.
:::

### Other Platforms

For non-Android platforms, initialization is similar but without the Android-specific storage provider:

```kotlin
fun initTolgee() {
    Tolgee.init {
        contentDelivery {
            url = "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix"
            // Create a custom storage provider for caching the latest translations from CDN if needed
        }
    }
}
```

### **Optional**: Verify connectivity locally:

```bash
curl -I "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix/en.json"
```

You should receive a 200 response.
If you get 403 (Forbidden) or 404 (Not found), double‑check the prefix.
