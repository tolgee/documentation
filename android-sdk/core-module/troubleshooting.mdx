#Troubleshooting (Core Module)

## Fast Checklist

Before diving into troubleshooting, quickly review this list to steer clear of the most common erroes.

### General Setup

- **Check if Maven Central is in repositories** - `mavenCentral` in `settings.gradle.kts`.
- **Check if CDN URL is proper and accessible** - test connection locally:

```bash
curl -I "https://cdn.tolg.ee/your-cdn-url-prefix/en.json"
```

- **Check if network security is configured** - (`network_security.xml` reference with `Android manifest`).
- **Check if cache clears after an app update** (use `TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid`).

### Code & Integration

- **Check if Same strings are used in both code/resources and Tolgee Platform.**
- **Check if Tolgee multiplatform helpers are shared among common code** (io.tolgee.compose.stringResource / pluralStringResource).
- **Check if you are subscribed to tolgee.changeFlow** for UI recomposition.
- **Check if single Tolgee instance is used per app.**
- **Check if Correct formatter is used** (Sprintf vs ICU).

## Error handling

- Log fetch failures and fall back to cache/static values.
- Consider retry/backoff for transient network errors.

## Testing

- Provide test doubles for content delivery to return deterministic values.
- For UI tests, inject a test Tolgee instance with preloaded data.

## Common Issues

### Dependency Issues

- Make sure Maven Central is included in your repositories - check the dependency in your build.gradle.kts.
- If using a Version Catalog, confirm that version.ref = "tolgee" points to the correct version.

### Translation Issues

- Check that your Tolgee instance is properly initialized (in Application with applicationContext).
- Verify CDN URL prefix in Tolgee Platform.
- Check that your storage provider is properly configured
- Make sure all keys used in code/resources are also present in Tolgee Platform.
- Make sure you're calling Tolgee.init before accessing translations.
- Use tolgee.preload or tolgee.tFlow before calling tolgee.t to ensure translations are loaded.

### Network Security Issues

- Add a network_security.xml in your res/xml folder (You can reference it in AndroidManifest.xml).

### Locale Issues

- Use tolgee.changeFlow to monitor locale changes and update your UI accordingly.
- Call tolgee.preload(this) function for critical screens (e.g., login, onboarding).
- Verify that your project supports the locale code you're using.
- Check that translations for the selected locale exist in your Tolgee project.
- Use a mock or explicit instance for tests/previews.

### Plurals & Formatting Issues

- Make sure plural resources exist both in Android (plurals.xml) and Tolgee Platform.
- Use the correct formatter (Sprintf vs ICU).
- Ensure translations in Tolgee Platform match the expected format style.

### Android Resource Integration Issues

- Check that your Android resources are properly structured - Tolgee is using resources.getResourceEntryName to find key for the resource.
- Make sure the Tolgee instance has access to the Android application context.
- Ensure that the TolgeeStorageProviderAndroid is properly initialized with the context and version code which changes with each app update.

### Multiplatform (KMP) Issues

- Verify that your resource files are correctly set up and all strings present in resources are also in Tolgee Platform.
- Make sure that you are using the correct resource references.
