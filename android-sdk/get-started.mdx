import SystemCard from '@site/src/component/SystemCard';

## What You'll Achieve

After completing the setup, your app will have:

- **Translations** delivered via CDN.
- **Offline support** with local caching.
- **Runtime language switching** without app restart.
- **Fallback support** to bundled Android resources.
- **Over-the-Air updates** for translations without app republishing.
