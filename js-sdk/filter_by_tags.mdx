You can configure Tolgee to only use keys with certain tags. This can be useful if you are sharing translations e.g. between multiple platforms (e.g. web and mobile).

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .init({
    filterTag: ['web']
    ...
  })
```

With this setup, Tolgee SDK will only load keys with the given tag. If you specify multiple tags, keys with any of the specified tags will be loaded.
