---

To change language use [`changeLanguage`](./api/core_package/tolgee.mdx#changelanguage) method.

```ts
await tolgee.changeLanguage('es');
```

## Getting current language

When Tolgee is running, this will first change `pendingLanguage` property, loads required translation file(s) (when they are not already in the cache) and then changes `language` property.

Use [`getLanguage`](./api/core_package/tolgee.mdx#getlanguage) or [`getPendingLanguage`](./api/core_package/tolgee.mdx#getpendinglanguage) methods to read current state.

You can also listen to `language` and `pendingLanguage` [events](./api/core_package/events).

> When Tolgee is not running, `changeLanguage` won't fetch translations, it only changes the internal state

## Language detection

Tolgee includes [`LanguageDetector`](./api/web_package/plugins#languagedetector) plugin, which tries to detect language from browser `window.navigator.language` property. 

If you use language detector Tolgee needs to know available languages which you can provide with `availableLanguages` property or if you provide `staticData` it will be taken from there. You also have to provide `defaultLanguage` property, so Tolgee knows which language should be picked if detection fails.

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(LanguageDetector())
  .init({
    availableLanguages: ['en', 'cs', 'es', 'fr'],
    defaultLanguage: 'en'
  })
```

## Language storage

Once user selects his language Tolgee can remember it for the next time. Use [`LanguageStorage`](./api/web_package/plugins#languagestorage) plugin, for storing language settings in the browser local storage.

Tolgee checks if the stored language is valid and because of that you need to specify `availableLanguages` or define language data through `staticData`.

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(LanguageStorage())
  .init({
    availableLanguages: ['en', 'cs', 'es', 'fr'],
  })
```

If you want to implement custom language detector or language storage, you create custom plugin with our [Plugin API](./api/core_package/plugin-api).
