Tolgee events which can be listened through `tolgee.on` method.

### language

Emitted on language change.

```ts
tolgee.on('language', handler: Handler<LanguageEvent>)
```

### pendingLanguage

Emitted on language change. Before languages are loaded (when tolgee is running).

```ts
tolgee.on('pendingLanguage', handler: Handler<PendingLanguageEvent>)
```

### loading

Emitted on loading change. Changes when tolgee is loading some data for the first time.

```ts
tolgee.on('loading', handler: Handler<LoadingEvent>)
```

### fetching

Emitted on fetching change. Changes when tolgee is fetching any data.

```ts
tolgee.on('fetching', handler: Handler<FetchingEvent>)
```

### initialLoad

Emitted when `run` method finishes.

```ts
tolgee.on('initialLoad', handler: Handler<InitialLoadEvent>)
```

### running

Emitted when internal `running` state changes.

```ts
tolgee.on('running', handler: Handler<RunningEvent>)
```

### cache

Emitted when cache changes.

```ts
tolgee.on('cache', handler: Handler<CacheEvent>)
```

### update

Emitted when any key needs (or might need) to be re-rendered. It's derrived from other events
(`initialLoad`, `language`, `cache`), the events are grouped when multiple happen at the same time,
so it only results to one `update` event being emitted.

```ts
tolgee.on('update', handler: CombinedHandler<UpdateEvent>)
```

You can check what events triggered this change event from the first argument of the handler.

```ts
tolgee.on('update', (events) => events.forEach(e => ...))
```

### error

Emitted when there is an error. You can intercept different types of errors, connected to fetching language data, detecting language or loading/storing language, you can filter them by `name` property on the error, which can be:
 - `RecordFetchError` - error when fetching translations record, you can also read `language` and `namespace` properties, to see which record has failed
 - `LanguageDetectorError` - error when detecting language through language detector plugin
 - `LanguageStorageError` - error when loading/saving language through language storage plugin

```ts
tolgee.on('error', handler: Handler<ErrorEvent>)
```
