## `InContextTools`

Contains [`InvisibleObserver`](./plugins#invisibleobserver), [`ContextUi`](./plugins#contextui) and [`DevBackend`](./plugins#devbackend) in one plugin, which you can use when you want to enable in-context capability anywhere. It only applies plugins if there they are not already applied. You can optionaly provide credentials to Tolgee platform, which will override anything that was set before.

This plugin is automatically downloaded and applied by [`BrowserExtensionPlugin`](./plugins#browserextensionplugin), when you enable in-context translating.

```ts
tolgee.use(InContextTools(props?: InContextOptions));
```

```ts
type InContextOptions = {
  credentials: {
    apiUrl?: string;
    apiKey?: string;
    projectId?: string | number;
  };
};
```

Can be applied even when `Tolgee` is already running.

## `DevTools`

Same as `InContextTools`, except it only apply the plugin in dev mode (based on `process.env.NODE_ENV`), so it will be omitted in production (and won't extend your bundle size).
