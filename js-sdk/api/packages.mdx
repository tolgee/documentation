## Dependency graph

![img](/img/docs/web/packages.svg)

### @tolgee/core

Main `Tolgee` module, which is highly extensible with plugins. Its main purpose is to manage the translations cache
and provide access to it through the `t` method (which returns translation by key). It also allows you to listen
to language changes, translation changes, cache changes etc.

### @tolgee/web

Extends `@tolgee/core` with web-specific modules. Mainly it contains `InContextTools`/`DevTools` plugins.
These plugins allow you to connect to `tolgee platform` and edit your translations directly in your app
(read more in [In-context translating](/in_context.mdx)).

### Integration libraries

Provide framework/library specific wrappers around `Tolgee`.

### @tolgee/format-icu

Provides plugin for [Icu message format](/platform/icu_message_format).
