You can render HTML tags in translations using the [`t` attribute](./translating#t-attribute) or the [`translate` pipe](./translating#translate-pipe).

To render a translation containing HTML tags using pipe, you must set the translated value via the `innerHTML` attribute of the wrapping component.

Consider a translation for the key `hello_peter` with the English value `Hello <b>Peter</b>!`

You can render it using the `translate` pipe as follows:
```html
<div [innerHTML]="'hello_peter' | translate"></div>
```

To render a translation containing HTML tags using the `t` attribute, you must set the translated value via the `innerHTML` attribute of the wrapping component.

```html
<div t key="hello_peter" [isHtml]="true"></div>
```

## Security

Tolgee sanitizes HTML tags in translations. It removes all HTML tags and attributes that are not allowed.

The HTML is automatically sanitized for both `t` component and `translate` pipe. However, if you don't expect HTML strings in your code, avoid passing the strings using innerHtml.

```html
<b onmouseover=alert('XSS testing!')>Hello Peter!</b>
```

The above code is sanitized to: `<b>Hello Peter!</b>`
