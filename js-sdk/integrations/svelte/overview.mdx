description: "Tolgee enables you to implement localization in your Svelte application with ease. You can integrate Tolgee in your Svelte application using Tolgee's integration library for Svelte."

Tolgee provides an integration library for Svelte, based on the [`@tolgee/web`](../../api/web_package/about) package. Using the [@tolgee/svelte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tolgee/svelte) library, you can connect your Svelte application to the Tolgee platform. This library enables you to implement [in-context translations](../../in-context), [language detection](../../language#language-detection), interpolation, and other advanced features.

- Follow the [installation guide](./installation) to add the Tolgee Svelte integration library to your existing Svelte application.
- You can also check the [example application](https://github.com/tolgee/svelte-example) to see how to integrate Tolgee with Svelte.
