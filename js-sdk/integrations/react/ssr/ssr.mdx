To use Tolgee with your SSR framework such as Next or Gatsby, you can provide localization data imported as object
using staticData property of TolgeeProvider component, this data will be loaded directly into cache and immediately
available with first render for SSR. We also need to know user's locale already on the server and set it through Tolgee `language` option.

```jsx
import localeEn from 'i18n/en.json';
import localeDe from 'i18n/de.json';

...

const App = () => {
  // this needs to work on server
  const locale = ?

  const [tolgee] = useState(Tolgee({
    language: locale,
    staticData: {
      en: localeEn,
      de: localeDe,
    }
  }))

  return (
    <TolgeeProvider
      tolgee={tolgee}
      ...
    >
      ...
    </TolgeeProvider>
  )
}
```

> Why do we use `useState` for Tolgee initialization? We need tolgee to be ready with the data before children are rendered, `useEffect` would be more appropriate here, but then it won't work on the server. So we need a way how to initialize `Tolgee` only once and immediately during the render.

With this approach we include all translations directly in the bundle regardless user locale. For smaller projects this is not a big issue, however it might be significant for large applications with many translations and languages.

For these cases we need to only provide statically the locale, that the user is currently using. We can also use async functions in `staticData` which will be used for fetching translations dynamically on client side (you can use this instead of having them in public folder).

```jsx
const App = () => {
  // we need to get these on server, which we'll need to implement
  // differently for each framework
  const locale = ?
  const localeTranslations = ?

  const [tolgee] = useState(Tolgee({
    language: locale,
    staticData: {
      en: () => import('i18n/en.json'),
      de: () => import('i18n/de.json'),
      [locale]: localeTranslations
    }
  }))

  return (
    <TolgeeProvider
      tolgee={tolgee}
      ...
    >
      ...
    </TolgeePrivider>
  )
}
```

## Language changing

When we use SSR, we have to specify language in a way that is detectable by both client and server. Easiest way is to
include it directly in URL - both next.js and Gatsby have support for this.

Then for language change we use the native way of the framework.
