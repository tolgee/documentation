title: Tolgee with Next.js
description: 'Learn how to translate your strings directly in your application, and enjoy the features of Next.js in the same time.'

Tolgee SDK doesn't have a separate package for Next.js, we rather provide helper functions on top of [React integration](../installation) for easy setup. This allows us to provide a very flexible solution suiting every use case.

## Integration guides

 - [Next.js with pages router](./pages_router)
 - [Next.js with app router](./app_router)
 

 > Check [React docs](../installation) to get general knowledge about usage with React.
