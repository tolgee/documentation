Tolgee provides an SDK for Vue, based on the [`@tolgee/web`](../../api/web_package/about) package. Using the SDK [@tolgee/vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tolgee/vue), you can connect your Vue application to the Tolgee platform. This SDK enables you to implement [in-context translations](../../in-context), [language detection](../../language#language-detection), interpolation, and other advanced features.

- Follow the [installation guide](./installation) to add the Tolgee Vue SDK to your existing Vue application.
- You can also check the [example application](https://github.com/tolgee/vue-example) to see how to integrate Tolgee with Vue.
