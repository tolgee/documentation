Tolgee SDK supports multiple frameworks/libraries, which are all based on a common web package `@tolgee/web`.
We also have a plugin to a [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) library, which can be useful if you already use it in your project or you need advanced i18n features offered by i18next.

You can also use Tolgee with Vanilla JS.
