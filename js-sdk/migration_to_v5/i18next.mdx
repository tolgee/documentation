In version 5, the core library was completely redesigned. Before you start, please read the [general info about
this new version](./core.mdx).

## Namespaces

Since Tolgee now supports namespaces you can now use them directly from i18next.

Because i18next doesn't let you have empty namespaces (""), you have to move your translations to some namespace in Tolgee Platform (`i18next` defaults to "translation"). Otherwise, Tolgee returns no translations.
