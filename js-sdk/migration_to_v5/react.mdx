description: "Tolgee JS React version 5 changelog + migration guide"
---
In version 5, the core library was completely redesigned. Before you start, please read the [general info about
this new version](./core.mdx).

Update TolgeeProvider component and initialize Tolgee as described in [core migration](./core#tolgee-initialization):

```typescript jsx
const tolgee = ...

...

<TolgeeProvider tolgee={tolgee} fallback="Loading...">
  <Children />
</TolgeeProvider>
```

### Changing language

We've removed v4 `useCurrentLanguage` and `useSetLanguage` hooks, which are now replaced by the more general hook `useTolgee` ([read more](/integrations/react/switching_languages.mdx)).

```typescript jsx
const tolgee = useTolgee(['language']);

...

<select
  value={tolgee.getLanguage()}
  onChange={(e) => tolgee.changeLanguage(e.event.target)}
>
  ...
</select>
```

### Translating

`useTranslate` now returns an object with `t` function instead of the function directly.

```typescript jsx
const { t } = useTranslate();
```

Tags interpolation is now supported only with `<T>` component and not with `t` function. The types for `t` function were too complicated as it could return string or react component based on input. Now it's more straightforward.
