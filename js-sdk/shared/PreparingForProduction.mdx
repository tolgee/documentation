In production mode, you should never use localization data from Tolgee REST API and never leak your API key.
You should use data exported from the Tolgee platform.
To get exported localization files, see [exporting translations](/platform/exporting_translations).

Then provide the data via Tolgee configuration options described in [Providing static data](/providing_static_data.mdx).
