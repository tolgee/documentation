title: Migration to v5
description: "Tolgee JS version 5 changelog + migration guide: New core and changes in integrations."
---

In this version we did a complete rewrite of core functionality, so the core has quite a different API. The goal was to make it more compact and move a lot of functionality into plugins, so we save bundle size and allow customization.

## Packages organization

Packages are now organized, so you only need to install (and use) the most specific package. If you want to use Tolgee with vanilla JS, you should just install `@tolgee/web` (while `@tolgee/core` will be installed as a dependency). You can then import everything from `@tolge/web`. Similarly, if you want integration for React, just install `@tolgee/react` and it installs and exports everything from `@tolgee/web` and `@tolgee/core`, so you don't have to worry about these packages.

## Tolgee initialization

Rather than integrations doing Tolgee initialization for you, we now require you to do Tolgee initialization yourself. It requires a bit more work on your side, but now you have complete access to Tolgee instance which allows more flexibility in the way how you use Tolgee ([read more](/initialization.mdx)).

Basic initialization:

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(DevTools())
  .use(FormatSimple())
  .init({
    language: 'en'
    ...
  })

// pass tolgee to integration
// or call tolgee.run() and use it without integration
```

### Plugins

Some of Tolgee functionality was moved to plugins, so it's now not included by default:

 - ICU formatter - now shipped in separate package [`@tolgee/format-icu`](/formatting.mdx#icu-formatter), in examples we use [`FormatSimple`](/formatting.mdx#simple-formatter), which is simplified formatter with small bundle size included directly in core.
 - In-context translating tools are now in a plugin called [`InContextTools`](/api/web_package/bundled_plugins.mdx#incontexttools) or `DevTools` (which is the same, only conditionally exported to only be included in dev mode)
 - Fetching static json files - [`BackendFetch`](/api/web_package/plugins.mdx#backendfetch)
 - Language storage - [`LanguageStorage`](/api/web_package/plugins.mdx#languagestorage)
 - Language detection - [`LanguageDetector`](/api/web_package/plugins.mdx#languagedetector)

### Different `fallbackLanguage` behavior

In v4 `fallbackLanguage` was set to `en` by default, but the language file was only fetched when some key was missing. We've now changed that to `fallbackLanguage` being empty by default and if you set it, it will automatically fetch it right at the start, so it's immediately available ([read more](/api/core_package/options.mdx#fallbacklanguage)).

### Unification of `t` interface

Function `t` now has the same interface in all integrations. It has some breaking changes
([read more](/api/core_package/tolgee.mdx#t)).

## Migration React

Update TolgeeProvider component and initialize Tolgee outside:

```ts
const tolgee = ...

...

<TolgeeProvider tolgee={tolgee} fallback="Loading...">
  <Children />
</TolgeeProvider>
```

### Language change

We've removed v4 `useCurrentLanguage` and `useSetLanguage` hooks, which are now replaced by the more general hook `useTolgee` ([read more](/integrations/react/switching_languages.mdx)).

```ts
const tolgee = useTolgee(['language']);

...

<select
  value={tolgee.getLanguage()}
  onChange={(e) => tolgee.changeLanguage(e.event.target)}
>
  ...
</select>
```

### Translating

`useTranslate` now returns an object with `t` function instead of the function directly.

```ts
const { t } = useTranslate();
```

Tags interpolation is now supported only with `<T>` component and not with `t` function. The types for `t` function were too complicated as it could return string or react component based on input. Now it's more straightforward.

## Migration Svelte

Update TolgeeProvider component and initialize Tolgee outside:

```ts
const tolgee = ...

...

<TolgeeProvider tolgee={tolgee}>
  <div slot="fallback">Loading...</div>
  <Children/>
</TolgeeProvider>
```

### Language change

We've removed v4 `getLanguageStore`, it's now replaced by the more general hook `useTolgee` ([read more](/integrations/svelte/switching_language.mdx)).

```ts
<script>
  import { getTolgee } from '@tolgee/svelte';

  const tolgee = getTolgee(['language'])

  function handleLanguageChange(e) {
    $tolgee.changeLanguage(e.currentTarget.value)
  }
</script>

<select value={$tolgee.getLanguage()} on:change={handleLanguageChange}>
  ...
</select>
```

### Translating

`useTranslate` now returns an object with `t` store instead of the `t` directly.

```ts
const { t } = useTranslate();

...

$t('key')
```

## Migration Vue

Vue integration now contains VueTolgee plugin:

```ts
const tolgee = ...

...

app.use(VueTolgee, { tolgee });

...

<template>
  <TolgeeProvider>
    <template v-slot:fallback>
      <div>Loading...</div>
    </template>
    <Children />
  </TolgeeProvider>
</template>
```

### Language change

We've removed v4 `useLanguage`, it's now replaced by the more general hook `useTolgee` ([read more](/integrations/vue/switching_languages.mdx)).

```ts
<template>
  <select :value="tolgee.getLanguage()" v-on:change="changeLanguage">
    ...
  </select>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { useTolgee } from '@tolgee/vue';

  const tolgee = useTolgee(['language']);

  const changeLanguage = (e) => {
    tolgee.value.changeLanguage(e.target.value);
  };
</script>
```

### Translating

You can now use the global `$t` function, which is available through Vue plugin.

```ts
<template>
  <div :title="$t('key')">...</div>
</template>
```

Or use `useTranslate` composable, which is useful with namespaces.

`TolgeeMixin` was removed completely.
