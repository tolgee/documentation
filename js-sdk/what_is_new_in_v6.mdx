Version 6 is only mild change in comparison to version 5.

## Data fetching on Backend

Tolgee SDK can now easily be used to fetch the data on the backend instead of manual
loading of static files. We have two new methods:

```
async tolgee.loadRequired()
async tolgee.loadMatrix({ languages: string[], namespaces: string[] })
```

Tolgee can basically be used as a simple client for fetching localization files.
The result of these methods is serializable as a JSON and can be passed to `staticData` property,
so you can easily pass static data from backend to client while re-using the same configuration.
