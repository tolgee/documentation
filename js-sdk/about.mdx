Tolgee SDK provides the functionality of an i18n library and helps you with formatting, interpolation, or language detection.
It also serves as a bridge to the Tolgee Platform through in-context translating, which allows you to generate one-click screenshots and edit translations directly in your app.

## In-context translating

Use in-context translating for local development. It will speed up development and save you from tedious localization tasks.

## Automated screenshots generation

Generate one-click screenshots with in-context and [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) extension. Your translators will now know the exact context of the translation.

## Review translations

Check how your translations look directly in your app and mark them as reviewed.

## In-context on production

You can also enable in-context translating live on the production version of your web application. Now anyone with [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) can use in-context without complicated setup.
