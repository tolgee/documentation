---

Tolgee includes [`LanguageDetector`](./api/web_package/plugins#languagedetector) plugin, which tries to detect language from browser `window.navigator.language` property. 

If you use language detector Tolgee needs to know available languages which you can provide with `availableLanguages` property or if you provide `staticData` it will be taken from there. You also have to provide `defaultLanguage` property, so Tolgee knows which language should be picked if detection fails.

```ts
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(LanguageDetector())
  .init({
    availableLanguages: ['en', 'cs', 'es', 'fr'],
    defaultLanguage: 'en'
  })
```
