Tolgee SDK is designed as regular i18n library and therefore it can be used as such without integration with Tolgee Platform. If you won't include `apiUrl` and `apiKey` to the Tolgee options it will only fetch data locally.

```ts
import { Tolgee, DevTools } from '@tolgee/web';

const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(DevTools())
  .use(FormatSimple())
  .init({
    language: 'en',
    staticData: {
      ...
    }
  });
```

> For more options check [Providing static data](./providing-static-data)

### Static files structure

You can manage static files manually and use DevTools for easier access to translation key. Tolgee accepts json files with either flat or nested structure:

```json
{
  "nested.key": "Key"
}
```

This is also accepted:

```json
{
  "nested": {
    "key": "Key"
  }
}
```
