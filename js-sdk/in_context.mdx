For local development, supply `apiUrl`, `apiKey` options (see [Integration](/platform/integrations/about_integrations)) and [`DevTools`](./api/web_package/tools#devtools) plugin. If you set everything properly, you can use in-context translating:

1.  Press and hold `Alt`/`Option` key
2.  Navigate mouse over any translation on your website
3.  It should get highlighted
4.  Click on it to open "Quick translation" dialog
5.  You can edit translations (changes will get stored to Tolgee platform)

> NOTE: If you use Tolgee without any integration, make sure you call [`run`](./api/core_package/tolgee.mdx#run) method.

## One-click screenshots

To generate screenshots automatically, you have to have installed
[Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin
for Google Chrome browser. With this plugin, you can generate screenshots by clicking camera icon in Tolgee UI
translation dialog.

:::info
[`DevTools`](./api/web_package/tools#devtools) are automatically omitted in production builds (based on `NODE_ENV` variable).
:::

## In-context on production

If you want to enable in-context on production build, there are two options:

### 1. Tolgee Chrome plugin

To enable in-context translating on production you can pass `apiKey` and `apiUrl` through [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin, that way Tolgee will switch to development mode (plugin will also supply `@tolgee/ui` package automatically).

:::warning
Never include `apiKey` in Tolgee configuration on production.
This property is intended only for local development, as it's not meant to be publicly visible.
:::

1.  Install [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin
2.  Go to the production version of your website
3.  Click on Tolgee Tools extension and apply your API key (you might need to reload if you just installed the plugin)
4.  In-context translating should work

#### A few notes about Tolgee Tools plugin

- You can turn off development mode by switching "Applied" toggle, which will turn it off, but stores credentials locally so you don't have to fill it again next time
- Plugin will supply `apiUrl` from Tolgee configuration if it's present (if not you can fill it manually)
- Plugin changes its icon if Tolgee is present on the page or if credentials are set

### 2. Using InContextTools instead of DevTools

DevTools are automatically omitted in production build (based on `NODE_ENV` variable), if you want to enable In-context unconditionally, you can use [`InContextTools`](/api/web_package/tools.mdx#incontexttools) (from `@tolgee/web/tools` package).

Note that [`InContextTools`](/api/web_package/tools.mdx#incontexttools) will significantly increase your bundle size, so we recommend using dynamic import and only including them when needed.

:::warning
In-context on production should be always behind some authentication or in a private network. Make sure you are not exposing your credentials publicly.
:::

```ts
// initialize tolgee without DevTools
const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(FormatSimple())
  .init({
    ...
  });

// include in-context tools only if needed
if (shouldIncludeInContextTools) {
  import('@tolgee/web/tools').then((module) => {
    tolgee.addPlugin(module.InContextTools())
  })
}
```

#### Using parts of InContextTools functionality

[`InContextTools`](/api/web_package/tools.mdx#incontexttools) (or `DevTools` in development) are a combination of multiple plugins, which you can include independently, check [`InContextTools`](/api/web_package/tools.mdx#incontexttools) documentation for more info.

## Modals, popovers and other focus-stealing elements
Some elements like modals or popovers can steal focus from the Tolgee dev tools,
so you can't type in the translation input fields.

Fortunately, you can still use the dev tools by opening them in a separate popup window by clicking the icon next to the `Quick translation` dialog title.

Your browser might block the popup, so you have to allow it.

  alt="Open new window button"
